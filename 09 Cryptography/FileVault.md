**FileVault** is Apple‚Äôs built-in **Full Disk Encryption (FDE)** solution for macOS systems. It uses **XTS-AES-128** encryption with a 256-bit key to protect the entire startup disk, ensuring that data remains secure even if the device is lost or stolen.

FileVault helps enforce **data-at-rest protection**, especially for laptops and mobile professionals.

## üéØ Purpose of FileVault

- Prevent unauthorized access to files on macOS systems
- Protect sensitive data in the event of device theft or loss
- Enforce security and compliance policies (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)
- Provide seamless integration with Apple‚Äôs ecosystem and MDM solutions

---

## üîê How FileVault Works

- Encrypts the **entire startup volume**
- Encryption key is tied to the user‚Äôs login password and optionally stored securely in:
  - **iCloud** (with user consent)
  - **Recovery Key** (manually saved)
  - **Institutional Key** (managed via MDM)

Access to the system is only granted after successful authentication during boot.
