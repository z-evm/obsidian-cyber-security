## üìå What Is Quantum Cryptography?

- A **next-generation cryptographic approach** that uses **quantum physics**, not math-based assumptions.
- Ensures **information-theoretic security** ‚Äî cannot be broken even by quantum computers.
- Primarily used today in **key exchange**, not encryption itself.

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Qubits**                 | Quantum bits that can be in multiple states simultaneously                  |
| **Superposition**          | A qubit can be both 0 and 1 until measured                                 |
| **Entanglement**           | Linked qubits maintain a correlation regardless of distance                 |
| **No-Cloning Theorem**     | Qubits cannot be copied without disturbing the system                       |
| **Observation Disturbs State** | Measuring a quantum system alters it ‚Äî used to detect eavesdropping    |

## üîê Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD enables two parties to securely share a **symmetric key** using quantum properties.

### üîÑ How It Works (e.g., BB84 Protocol):

1. Alice sends polarized photons to Bob.
2. Bob randomly measures each photon‚Äôs polarization.
3. They compare measurement **bases** over a public channel.
4. Matching measurements ‚Üí secret key bits.
5. Eavesdropping alters photon states ‚Üí detectable.

> **Result:** Secure key exchange that reveals interception attempts.

## üì¶ Quantum Cryptography vs Classical

| Feature               | Classical Cryptography              | Quantum Cryptography                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Security Basis**    | Mathematical difficulty             | Quantum physics laws                      |
| **Key Distribution**  | Public key infrastructure (PKI)     | Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)            |
| **Interception**      | Hard to detect                      | Always detectable                         |
| **Resistance to Quantum Attacks** | Vulnerable (RSA, ECC)             | Resistant (not reliant on factorization)  |

## üß™ Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (Post-Quantum Crypto)

- **Quantum cryptography ‚â† quantum-resistant encryption.**
- Quantum-resistant algorithms are classical encryption schemes designed to withstand quantum attacks.

| Algorithm Type            | Examples                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Lattice-based**         | CRYSTALS-Kyber, NTRU                    |
| **Hash-based**            | SPHINCS+                               |
| **Code-based**            | Classic McEliece                       |
| **Multivariate**          | Rainbow (not NIST-finalist)            |

> NIST is standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
