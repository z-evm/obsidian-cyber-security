**Resilience Planning** involves designing systems, processes, and policies that enable an organization to continue operating during and after disruptions. It integrates cybersecurity, business continuity, and disaster recovery strategies to ensure **availability**, **reliability**, and **adaptability**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Maintain **critical operations** during disruptions
- Minimize **downtime and data loss**
- Ensure **rapid recovery** from cyberattacks, natural disasters, or system failures
- Align with **compliance mandates** (e.g., ISO, NIST, CIS)

## 🧱 Core Pillars of Resilience

| Pillar              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Redundancy**       | Multiple systems/components to ensure no single point of failure            |
| **Failover**         | Automatic switch to a standby system upon failure                           |
| **Scalability**      | Ability to handle increased demand or shift resources                        |
| **Data Protection**  | Regular backups, replication, encryption                                     |
| **Incident Response**| Quick detection, containment, and mitigation                                |
| **Workforce Continuity** | Remote access, communication plans, staffing models                   |

## 🛠️ Key Elements of a Resilience Plan

| Element                        | Purpose                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** | Identify critical systems and recovery priorities           |
| **Risk Assessment**            | Evaluate threats and vulnerabilities                         |
| **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan**| Restore services post-failure                                |
| **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** | Ensure essential functions continue                          |
| **Backup Strategy**            | Define RTO/RPO, media types, and schedules                   |
| **Tabletop Exercises**         | Test preparedness without disrupting operations              |
| **Communication Plan**        | Coordinate stakeholders during and after incidents           |

## 🧮 Key Metrics

| Metric | Description                                         |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **RTO**| Recovery Time Objective (how quickly to recover)    |
| **RPO**| Recovery Point Objective (how much data loss is acceptable) |
| **MTTR**| Mean Time to Repair (average restore time)         |
| **MTBF**| Mean Time Between Failures (reliability measure)   |
| **MTO**| Maximum Tolerable Outage (threshold before major damage) |

## 🧠 Example Scenario

> A SaaS company ensures its customer portal remains functional even during a regional power outage by deploying:
> - Redundant data centers in different regions
> - Automatic failover to cloud infrastructure
> - Daily offsite backups
> - Regular tabletop exercises simulating DDoS and ransomware scenarios
