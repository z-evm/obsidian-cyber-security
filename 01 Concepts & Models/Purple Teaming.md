**Purple Teaming** is a collaborative security practice where **Red Team (attackers)** and **Blue Team (defenders)** work together to improve an organization's **detection, response, and resilience** to real-world cyber threats.

Unlike isolated red or blue exercises, purple teaming emphasizes **knowledge sharing** and **iterative improvement**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Purple Teaming answers the question:**  
> _"How can we test and strengthen our defenses‚Äîtogether?"_

Goals:
- Simulate real-world adversary behavior (TTPs)
- Test and validate detection and response capabilities
- Reduce gaps between offensive and defensive security
- Build shared understanding across security functions

## üß± Red vs Blue vs Purple

| Team        | Role                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Red Team** | Simulates real-world attackers (ethical) |
| **Blue Team**| Detects, defends, and responds to attacks|
| **Purple Team**| Coordinates and aligns Red and Blue efforts for continuous improvement |

## üß™ How Purple Teaming Works

| Phase                    | Description                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning**              | Define goals, scope, tools, and success criteria               |
| **Execution**             | Red Team runs simulated attacks using real TTPs                |
| **Observation**           | Blue Team defends and detects; all actions are monitored       |
| **Collaboration**         | Both teams discuss findings and gaps in real-time              |
| **Improvement**           | Detection rules, controls, and response processes are refined  |

> ‚úÖ Outcome: Enhanced **detection**, **alerting**, and **incident response** capabilities.

## üîÅ Purple Teaming Benefits

- Strengthens **collaboration** between offensive and defensive teams
- Improves **threat detection coverage**
- Enables **real-time feedback and tuning**
- Builds a **threat-informed defense model**
- Identifies **blind spots** that red or blue teams alone may miss

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges

- Requires time and trust between red/blue teams
- Needs mature tooling and telemetry coverage
- Can be resource-intensive without automation
- Misalignment with business risk can dilute outcomes

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use MITRE ATT&CK to guide simulation and detection mapping
- Integrate into continuous security improvement cycles
- Track lessons learned and develop detection playbooks
- Combine with **threat intelligence** for realism
- Use **atomic tests** before launching full simulations
