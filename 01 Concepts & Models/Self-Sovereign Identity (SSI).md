## üìå What Is SSI?

**Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** empowers users to:
- Create, manage, and present their digital identities.
- Store credentials securely in a digital wallet.
- Selectively share information with verifiers.
- Avoid relying on traditional identity providers (e.g., governments, Google, Facebook).

## üß† Core Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Control**               | Identity is owned and controlled by the user                                |
| **Decentralization**      | Uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) and DIDs for independence          |
| **Portability**           | Credentials can be used across different platforms                          |
| **Privacy**               | Users choose what to disclose and to whom                                    |
| **Interoperability**      | Based on open standards (W3C, DID, VC)                                      |
| **Verifiability**         | Credentials can be cryptographically verified                               |

## üß© Key Components

| Component        | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DIDs**         | Decentralized Identifiers that anchor identity to blockchain         |
| **VCs**          | Verifiable Credentials issued to DIDs, cryptographically signed      |
| **Digital Wallet**| Stores the user‚Äôs keys and credentials securely                     |
| **Issuer**       | A trusted party that issues credentials (e.g., university, government)|
| **Verifier**     | Entity that requests and validates the user‚Äôs credentials            |

---

## üîÑ SSI Credential Flow

1. **Issuance**: Trusted issuer issues a **VC** to a user‚Äôs **DID**.
2. **Storage**: Credential is stored in the user‚Äôs **digital wallet**.
3. **Presentation**: User presents the credential to a **verifier**.
4. **Verification**: Verifier checks the credential‚Äôs digital signature and issuer identity.
