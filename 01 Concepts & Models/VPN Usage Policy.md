A **VPN Usage Policy** outlines the rules, responsibilities, and technical requirements for securely connecting to an organization's internal network via a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**. It is critical for enforcing **confidentiality**, **data protection**, and **access control** in remote and hybrid work environments.

---

## üéØ Policy Objectives

- Ensure secure and encrypted remote access to internal resources  
- Prevent unauthorized use of corporate VPN services  
- Enforce endpoint security and authentication standards  
- Maintain compliance with regulatory frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST)

## üõ† VPN Access Requirements

| Requirement                    | Description                                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **MFA Enforcement**            | Mandatory for all VPN users (e.g., Duo, TOTP)   |
| **Approved VPN Client**        | Only organization-approved VPN software allowed |
| **Device Posture Check**       | Enforce antivirus, patch status, and encryption |
| **Allowed Devices**            | Must be enrolled in MDM or endpoint protection  |
| **No Split Tunneling**         | All traffic must route through the corporate VPN |

## üß™ Acceptable Usage

‚úÖ Permitted:

- Connecting to company resources during remote work
- Accessing internal tools for work-related tasks
- Using the VPN in accordance with [[Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)]]

‚ùå Prohibited:

- Streaming, torrenting, or personal use during VPN sessions  
- Sharing VPN credentials or using shared accounts  
- Installing unapproved VPN software or add-ons  
- Bypassing content filters or security controls via VPN

---

## üì° Logging & Monitoring

- VPN sessions are **logged and monitored** for:
  - Connection times
  - User/IP address
  - Bandwidth usage
  - Session duration
- Logs may be reviewed for **incident response**, **audit**, and **policy enforcement**

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Auto-disconnect idle VPN sessions (e.g., 15‚Äì30 mins of inactivity)  
- Enforce geo-fencing (e.g., block access from high-risk regions)  
- Automatically block outdated or non-compliant devices  
- Rotate VPN credentials regularly or use cert-based auth  
- Update VPN client configurations and software frequently

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences of Misuse

- **Account suspension** or network access revocation  
- **Disciplinary action** up to and including termination  
- Possible legal action for data breach or compliance violation
