The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a **voluntary guidance** developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.

It is widely adopted across both the public and private sectors for aligning cybersecurity strategy with business goals.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🧭 Provide a common language for cybersecurity risk management
- ⚖️ Align security practices with organizational and regulatory requirements
- 🔄 Enable continuous improvement in cybersecurity posture
- 📊 Foster risk-informed decision making

---

## 🧱 NIST CSF Structure

The framework consists of **three main components**:

### 1. **Core**
- Describes cybersecurity activities and outcomes across five high-level **Functions**

### 2. **Tiers**
- Describe the **maturity** and **risk management sophistication** of an organization

### 3. **Profiles**
- Help align business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources with cybersecurity outcomes

## 🧰 NIST CSF Core Functions

| Function    | Purpose                                              | Examples                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Identify**   | Understand the environment to manage risk          | Asset inventory, risk assessments, governance |
| **Protect**    | Implement safeguards to limit or contain impact    | Access control, awareness training, data security |
| **Detect**     | Identify cybersecurity events promptly             | Anomaly detection, continuous monitoring       |
| **Respond**    | Take action during a cybersecurity incident        | Incident response planning, communication     |
| **Recover**    | Restore services and capabilities after an incident| Backup, recovery planning, lessons learned    |

## 🔢 Implementation Tiers

| Tier | Description                             |
|------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Partial** – Ad hoc risk management    |
| 2    | **Risk Informed** – Some processes in place |
| 3    | **Repeatable** – Formal policies exist   |
| 4    | **Adaptive** – Continuous improvement     |

> 📌 Tiers are not maturity levels, but a way to express how risk is managed across the organization.

## 🧭 Profiles

A **Profile** represents the alignment of cybersecurity activities with business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

- **Current Profile**: Reflects the existing cybersecurity state
- **Target Profile**: Desired future state based on goals and risk strategy
- Gap analysis between profiles guides improvement planning.

## 🛡️ Benefits of NIST CSF

- Vendor-neutral and adaptable to any sector
- Facilitates regulatory alignment (e.g., HIPAA, FISMA, PCI DSS)
- Scales from small businesses to large enterprises
- Enhances communication between technical and executive teams

## 🛠 Integration with Other Frameworks

| Framework      | Alignment Role                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Provides detailed control catalog             |
| **COBIT / ISO 27001** | Governance and risk alignment               |
| **RMF (800-37)** | Risk Management Framework                       |
| **CIS Controls** | Tactical security controls                      |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Conduct regular risk assessments aligned with the **Identify** function
- Define and test incident response plans under the **Respond** function
- Monitor and tune detection mechanisms under the **Detect** function
- Train employees continuously as part of the **Protect** function
- Document lessons learned and recovery metrics under **Recover**
