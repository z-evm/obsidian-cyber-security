Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a dynamic and context-aware access control model where access decisions are made based on the **attributes** of users, resources, actions, and environments.

---

## üìå Definition

> ABAC evaluates **Boolean logic policies** using a combination of attributes to decide whether access should be granted.

## üß± Core Components

| Component        | Description                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subject**       | The user or entity requesting access (e.g., employee, service account)|
| **Object**        | The resource being accessed (e.g., file, database, application)       |
| **Action**        | The operation to perform (e.g., read, write, delete)                 |
| **Environment**   | Contextual info (e.g., time, location, device, IP, risk level)       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attribute Types

| Type           | Examples                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **User (Subject)**  | Department, job title, security clearance     |
| **Resource**        | Classification level, file type, owner        |
| **Action**          | Read, write, delete, copy                     |
| **Environment**     | Time of day, location, device health, MFA use |

## üß™ Example Policy

```plaintext
IF:
  user.department == "Finance" AND
  resource.type == "Report" AND
  action == "read" AND
  environment.time < 6PM
THEN:
  grant access
```

## ‚úÖ Advantages of ABAC

- üß† **Context-Aware**: Supports decisions based on real-time conditions.
- üîÑ **Highly Granular**: Fine-tuned control over who can access what and when.
- üß© **Scalable**: No need to define static roles for every scenario.
- üåê **Ideal for Cloud and Zero Trust** models.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- üìú **Policy Complexity**: Policies can be difficult to manage and audit at scale.
- üßë‚Äçüíº **Requires Central Policy Engine**: Often needs advanced IAM or PDP (Policy Decision Point).
- üß∞ **Implementation Overhead**: Attribute sourcing, syncing, and standardization required.

---

## üõ† Use Cases

- Cloud-native environments (e.g., AWS IAM, GCP IAM with conditions)
- Federated identity access systems
- Zero Trust architectures
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) enforcement
- Microservice-level access control
