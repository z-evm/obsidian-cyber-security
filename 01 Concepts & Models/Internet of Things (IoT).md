## 🛡 Security Concerns

IoT devices often lack robust security controls due to cost, size, and performance constraints.

### 🧨 Common IoT Security Risks

| Risk                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insecure Defaults**     | Default credentials, open ports                                             |
| **Unpatched Vulnerabilities** | Many IoT devices lack update mechanisms                                 |
| **Lack of Encryption**     | Data transmitted in plaintext                                              |
| **Poor Authentication**    | Weak or missing access controls                                            |
| **Supply Chain Risks**     | Malicious components, backdoors                                            |
| **Physical Access**        | Easy to tamper with or reverse-engineer                                    |

## 🧰 Mitigation Strategies

| Control Type         | Example Measures                                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**        | Change default passwords, enable encryption, network segmentation |
| **Detective**         | Monitor logs, anomaly detection, traffic analysis            |
| **Corrective**        | Patching (if supported), device replacement                  |
| **Physical**          | Tamper detection, restricted access                          |

> 🔐 Best Practice: Treat all IoT devices as **untrusted** until verified and segmented.
