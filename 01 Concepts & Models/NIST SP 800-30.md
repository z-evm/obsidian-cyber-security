**NIST Special Publication 800-30 Rev. 1** provides a structured and repeatable methodology for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems. It is aligned with the broader NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and supports security and privacy decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Support **risk-based decision-making**.
- Identify and evaluate **threats, vulnerabilities, impacts**, and **likelihood**.
- Inform **control selection**, **authorization**, and **continuous monitoring**.
- Comply with **FISMA** and **OMB A-130** requirements.

## 📋 Risk Assessment Process

NIST SP 800-30 defines a 4-step cyclical risk assessment process:

### 1. **Prepare for the Assessment**
- Define purpose, scope, assumptions, constraints.
- Identify system boundaries and assessment participants.
- Establish risk model and analysis approach (quantitative/qualitative).

### 2. **Conduct the Assessment**
- Identify:
  - **Threat sources** (e.g., APTs, insiders, natural events)
  - **Threat events** (e.g., data breach, service disruption)
  - **Vulnerabilities** (e.g., missing patches, misconfigs)
  - **Pre-disposing conditions** (e.g., existing controls, architecture)
- Determine:
  - **Likelihood** (of threat exploiting vulnerability)
  - **Impact** (harm to organization or mission)
- Derive:
  - **Risk** = Likelihood × Impact

### 3. **Communicate Results**
- Share risk findings with stakeholders (e.g., via risk register, dashboards).
- Use common taxonomy and visualization methods (e.g., heat maps).

### 4. **Maintain the Assessment**
- Integrate with **continuous monitoring**.
- Reassess based on triggers (e.g., new vulnerabilities, system changes).

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Source**       | Intentional (hackers) or unintentional (errors, disasters) origin of risk. |
| **Threat Event**        | Potential attack or incident scenario.                                      |
| **Vulnerability**       | Weakness that could be exploited by a threat event.                         |
| **Impact**              | Consequence of a successful exploit (financial, reputational, legal).      |
| **Likelihood**          | Probability a threat event results in impact.                              |
| **Risk**                | Combination of likelihood and impact.                                       |
| **Risk Tolerance**      | Level of risk an organization is willing to accept.                         |
