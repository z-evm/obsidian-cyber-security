A **Security Assessment Plan (SAP)** defines the scope, methodology, and approach used to evaluate the effectiveness of security and privacy controls implemented in an information system. It is developed before an assessment and used by security assessors (e.g., 3PAOs) to guide testing activities.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Establish the **rules of engagement** for the control assessment.
- Ensure all parties agree on **scope, methods, and expectations**.
- Satisfy FedRAMP, FISMA, and RMF requirements prior to generating a [[Security Assessment Report (SAR)]].
- Serve as a record of planned activities for compliance and audit purposes.

## üß± Core Components of an SAP

| Section                        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Assessment Objectives**       | Define the purpose, goals, and scope of the assessment.                     |
| **System Overview**            | Summary of the system boundary, architecture, environment, and data types.  |
| **Assessment Team**            | Identification of lead assessors, support staff, and roles.                 |
| **Security Categorization**    | Impact level (Low / Moderate / High) based on FIPS 199 and data sensitivity.|
| **Control Selection**          | List of controls to be tested (typically from NIST SP 800-53).              |
| **Assessment Methods**         | Describe whether controls will be evaluated via Test, Examine, or Interview.|
| **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**  | Ground rules, limitations, safety precautions, escalation points.           |
| **Assessment Schedule**        | Dates for pre-assessment, interviews, testing, and debrief.                 |
| **Deliverables**               | What artifacts will be produced (e.g., SAR, test results, evidence logs).   |

## üîç Assessment Methods (per NIST SP 800-53A)

| Method     | Description                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Examine** | Review policies, procedures, documentation.       |
| **Interview** | Engage personnel to verify awareness/understanding. |
| **Test**    | Execute manual or automated procedures to validate control function. |

## üìã Sample Control Assessment Table

| Control ID | Method(s)      | Assessment Approach        |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| AC-2       | Examine, Test   | Review user provisioning + test user creation/deletion. |
| AU-6       | Examine, Interview | Check SIEM configuration and ask SOC staff.           |
| SC-28      | Test            | Run encryption validation tests on stored data.         |

## üõ† Assessment Tools

- Vulnerability Scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS)  
- Log Analysis Platforms (e.g., Splunk, ELK)  
- Configuration Review Scripts  
- Manual inspection tools  
- Compliance checklists

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Collaborate with the **System Owner** and **ISSO** early.
- Ensure control implementation is **complete before assessment begins**.
- Tailor SAP for the **system impact level** and complexity.
- Predefine **communication and escalation protocols**.
- Maintain **evidence collection procedures** for audit trails.
