> Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the ability of a distributed system to function correctly and reach consensus even when some of its nodes fail or act maliciously.

## üìå What Is Byzantine Fault Tolerance?

- Named after the **Byzantine Generals Problem**: How can actors reach agreement when some may lie, crash, or behave inconsistently?
- A system is **Byzantine Fault Tolerant** if it can reach consensus **despite faulty or malicious nodes**.
- Critical for **blockchain**, **distributed databases**, and **consensus algorithms**.

## üß† Byzantine Fault vs Other Faults

| Fault Type             | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Crash Fault**         | Node stops responding                      |
| **Omission Fault**      | Node misses messages or updates            |
| **Byzantine Fault**     | Node behaves arbitrarily (e.g., lies, sends conflicting info) |

---

## üßÆ Tolerance Rule

- A system with **n nodes** can tolerate up to:
```
f = ‚åä(n - 1) / 3‚åã Byzantine nodes
```

- Requires at least **3f + 1** total nodes to maintain consensus.

> Example: To tolerate 1 faulty node ‚Üí need at least 4 total nodes.

## üß© Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

- One of the most well-known BFT algorithms.
- Developed by Castro & Liskov (1999).
- Consensus through **multi-phase messaging**:
- **Pre-prepare ‚Üí Prepare ‚Üí Commit**
- Used in permissioned blockchains like **Hyperledger Fabric**.

## üîê Properties of BFT Systems

| Property         | Description                                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**   | All honest nodes agree on the same state                                |
| **Liveness**      | The system continues to make progress even with faulty nodes            |
| **Safety**        | Faulty nodes cannot corrupt or fork the system's state                  |
| **Resilience**    | Handles partial trust and uncertain network conditions                 |

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blockchain**        | Consensus in permissioned or hybrid blockchains        |

## üîÑ BFT vs Other Consensus Models

| Consensus Model | Fault Type Tolerated       | Nodes Needed           | Examples                       |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **PoW**           | Crash, Sybil               | Open participation      | Bitcoin, Litecoin              |
| **PoS**           | Economic-based misbehavior | Stake-weighted          | Ethereum 2.0, Cardano          |
| **PBFT**          | Byzantine faults           | 3f + 1                  | Hyperledger Fabric, Zilliqa    |
| **Raft/Paxos**    | Crash faults only          | 2f + 1                  | Apache ZooKeeper, etcd         |

| Challenge             | Explanation                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**         | Message complexity increases quadratically with node count  |
| **Latency**             | Multi-phase consensus takes time                            |
| **Trust Assumptions**   | Works best in permissioned or semi-trusted networks          |
| **Sybil Attacks**       | Needs identity enforcement or stake requirement              |
