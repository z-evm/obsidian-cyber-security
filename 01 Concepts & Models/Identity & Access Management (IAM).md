**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is the **framework of policies, technologies, and processes** used to ensure that **the right individuals have the right access to the right resources at the right time ‚Äî and for the right reasons**.

IAM enforces **authentication**, **authorization**, and **accountability** across all users and systems.

## üéØ Purpose

> **IAM answers the questions:**  
> _"Who are you?"_  
> _"What are you allowed to do?"_

Goals:
- Manage **digital identities**
- Control **access to resources**
- Enforce **least privilege** and **segregation of duties**
- Enable **centralized and auditable access control**

## üß± Core Components of IAM

| Component           | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identification**   | Establishes user identity (e.g., username, user ID)          |
| **Authentication**   | Verifies identity (passwords, MFA, biometrics)               |
| **Authorization**    | Grants permission to resources based on policy               |
| **Accounting (Audit)**| Logs and monitors user activity for accountability           |
| **Provisioning**     | Granting/modifying/removing user access                      |
| **Federation**       | Enables SSO across different organizations or domains        |

## üõ† IAM Technologies

| Technology               | Function                                             |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Directory Services**    | Stores identity info (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP) |
| **SSO (Single Sign-On)**  | Authenticate once, access multiple systems          |
| **MFA (Multi-Factor Auth)** | Adds extra layers of verification                 |
| **RBAC / ABAC**           | Role- or attribute-based access control              |
| **Identity Federation**   | Use external identity provider (e.g., SAML, OIDC)   |
| **IAM Platforms**         | AWS IAM, Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity               |

## üîê IAM Policies

IAM policies define **who can do what** under specific **conditions**.

| Policy Element    | Example                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Subject**         | `User: alice@example.com`                 |
| **Action**          | `read`, `write`, `delete`                 |
| **Resource**        | `S3 bucket`, `database`, `app`            |
| **Condition**       | `if MFA used`, `during business hours`    |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Enforce **least privilege** for all accounts
- Use **MFA** for all sensitive access
- Centralize identity management with **directory services**
- Automate **access provisioning and deprovisioning**
- Regularly perform **access reviews** and certifications
- Implement **role-based access controls (RBAC)**
- Monitor and audit **all authentication and access events**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common IAM Pitfalls

- **Over-permissioned users**
- **Orphaned accounts** (former employees still have access)
- **Shared credentials** that break accountability
- **Lack of auditing** and real-time monitoring
- **Inconsistent policies** across platforms or environments

---

## üß© IAM in the Cloud

Cloud IAM platforms (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD) provide:
- Fine-grained permissions per service or resource
- Support for SSO and identity federation
- Built-in logging and alerting (e.g., AWS CloudTrail)
- Policy-as-code capabilities
