Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), are critical components of **network perimeter and internal defense**. They help control traffic flow and detect unauthorized or malicious activity.

## üî• Firewalls

A **firewall** acts as a **barrier** between trusted and untrusted networks, enforcing traffic rules based on policies.

### ‚û§ Types of Firewalls

| Type                     | Function                                                | Layer(s)     | Example Use Case                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Packet-Filtering**     | Filters traffic by IP, port, and protocol               | Layer 3/4    | Basic router ACLs                        |
| **Stateful Inspection**  | Tracks connection state (e.g., established vs new)      | Layer 3/4    | Modern enterprise perimeter firewall     |
| **Application-Aware (Proxy)** | Inspects Layer 7 traffic and protocols         | Layer 7      | Content filtering, web firewalls         |
| **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)** | Includes DPI, IDS/IPS, SSL inspection, app control | Layer 3‚Äì7    | Unified threat management (UTM) systems  |
| **Host-Based Firewall**  | Filters traffic on individual devices                   | Local system | Windows Defender Firewall, iptables      |

### ‚û§ Key Features

- **Allow/Deny Rules**: Based on IP, port, protocol
- **Zone-Based Policies**: WAN ‚Üî LAN ‚Üî DMZ
- **Logging & Monitoring**
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**

## üõ°Ô∏è IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

An IDS monitors network or host activity for **suspicious patterns** or **known threats**, generating alerts.

### ‚û§ Types of IDS

| Type     | Monitors          | Pros                          | Cons                          |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **NIDS** | Network traffic   | Broad visibility              | Blind to encrypted/host data |
| **HIDS** | Host logs/files   | Deep visibility on endpoints  | Limited to local system       |

> IDS is **passive**: it only detects and alerts. It does **not block** traffic.

## üõ† IDS Detection Methods

| Method         | Description                                | Example Tool          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Signature-Based** | Matches known attack patterns          | Snort, Suricata       |
| **Anomaly-Based**   | Detects deviation from baselines       | Bro/Zeek, OSSEC       |
| **Heuristic/Behavioral** | Identifies behavior-based threats | Advanced NIDS/HIDS    |

---

### üîç IPS Detection Methods

| Method               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Signature-Based**   | Detects known attack patterns                    |
| **Anomaly-Based**     | Detects deviations from normal behavior         |
| **Policy-Based**      | Custom rules that define acceptable behavior    |
| **Heuristic**         | Behaviorally infers malicious activity          |

## üí• IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

An IPS is an **active** system that **blocks** traffic in real-time. Often integrated with NGFW.

| IDS vs IPS      | IDS                         | IPS                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Role             | Detect only                 | Detect + Prevent             |
| Deployment       | TAP/SPAN                    | Inline                       |
| Risk             | Low risk of false positives | False positives may block good traffic |

## üîÅ Firewall vs IPS

| Feature              | Firewall                             | IPS                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function** | Allow/deny based on rules              | Detect and block threats in real time  |
| **Traffic Focus**    | Header and protocol-based filtering    | Deep packet/content inspection         |
| **Placement**        | Perimeter or host                      | Inline with traffic                    |
| **Response**         | Policy enforcement                     | Automated threat prevention            |
| **False Positives**  | Lower (static rules)                   | Higher (requires tuning)               |

## üîê Firewall Best Practices

- Implement **deny-all-by-default** policies
- Use **least privilege** rule design
- Regularly audit **open ports/services**
- Enable **logging and alerting**
- Segment networks with **VLANs and internal firewalls**
- Apply **rate limiting / DoS protections**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges

| Challenge              | Firewall                             | IPS                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Overblocking**        | Can interrupt legitimate services      | False positives may block good traffic |
| **Performance Impact**  | Minimal in stateless mode              | High if deep inspection is unoptimized |
| **Evasion Techniques**  | Fragmented or tunneled packets         | Encrypted traffic bypasses inspection  |
