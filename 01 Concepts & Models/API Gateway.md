An **API Gateway** is a centralized entry point that manages, secures, and routes client requests to backend microservices or APIs. It plays a key role in securing API ecosystems by enforcing **authentication, rate limiting, and traffic inspection**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of API Gateway Security

- 🛡️ Protect APIs from unauthorized access and abuse
- 📊 Monitor, log, and throttle incoming traffic
- 🔐 Enforce centralized security policies
- 🚪 Provide a single control point for distributed microservices

## 🧱 Key API Gateway Security Functions

| Function                     | Description                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication**            | Validate user identity via API keys, OAuth, JWT, etc.     |
| **Authorization**             | Enforce RBAC/ABAC before routing requests                 |
| **Rate Limiting**             | Prevent abuse and DoS attacks by throttling requests      |
| **Request Validation**        | Validate headers, tokens, and body formats                |
| **Data Transformation**       | Sanitize or format requests and responses                 |
| **Encryption (TLS)**          | Enforce HTTPS/TLS for secure communication                |
| **IP Filtering / Geo Blocking** | Restrict access by source IP or region                  |
| **Logging and Monitoring**    | Record usage, anomalies, and failures                     |
| **WAF Integration**           | Block known exploits and malicious payloads               |

## 🔐 Authentication Strategies

| Method           | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **API Keys**      | Simple shared secrets, limited control             |
| **OAuth 2.0**     | Token-based delegated authorization                |
| **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** | Self-contained tokens, signed and optionally encrypted |
| **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** | Both client and server present digital certificates        |

> 📌 Always validate tokens and apply expiration, revocation, and audience checks.

## ⚠️ Common API Gateway Threats

| Threat                         | Description                                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Token Manipulation**          | Tampering with JWT or session tokens              |
| **Credential Stuffing**         | Brute forcing access using stolen API keys        |
| **Injection Attacks**           | SQL, NoSQL, LDAP injections via query or body     |
| **Replay Attacks**              | Reusing valid tokens to repeat requests           |
| **Excessive Data Exposure**     | Returning too much sensitive data in responses    |
| **Broken Authentication/ACLs** | Missing or misconfigured auth rules               |

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🔐 Enforce TLS for all API communication (use HSTS)
- 🔑 Use short-lived, signed tokens (e.g., JWT with expiration)
- 🚫 Reject unauthorized or malformed requests early
- ⚙️ Set rate limits per user/IP/token
- 🧼 Apply input validation and output encoding
- 📊 Monitor API usage with SIEM integration
- 🔄 Rotate secrets and tokens regularly
- 🔁 Use caching to protect backend services from overload
