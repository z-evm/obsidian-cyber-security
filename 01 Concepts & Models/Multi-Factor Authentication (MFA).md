**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security mechanism that requires users to provide **two or more independent forms of verification** before gaining access to a system. It significantly strengthens identity assurance by reducing reliance on just passwords.

> ‚úÖ Something you **know**, ‚úÖ something you **have**, ‚úÖ something you **are**.

## üéØ Purpose of MFA

- Prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised
- Defend against phishing, credential stuffing, brute force
- Enforce strong authentication across sensitive systems
- Comply with standards (e.g., NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)

## üß± The 5 Authentication Factors

| Factor                  | Description                          | Example                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Something You Know**   | Information only the user should know| Password, PIN, passphrase             |
| **Something You Have**   | Physical item in user's possession   | Phone, smart card, OTP token          |
| **Something You Are**    | Biometric or inherent trait          | Fingerprint, retina, voice, face      |
| **Somewhere You Are**    | Location-based verification          | GPS, IP address, geofencing           |
| **Something You Do**     | Behavioral patterns                  | Typing rhythm, mouse movement         |

> MFA requires **two or more** of the above from **different categories**.

## üõ† Common MFA Implementations

| Method                 | Factor Type         | Notes                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **TOTP apps** (e.g., Authy, Google Authenticator) | Something you have | Time-based, rotating codes (RFC 6238)       |
| **SMS / Email codes**  | Something you have  | Less secure ‚Äî vulnerable to SIM swapping      |
| **Push notifications** | Something you have  | Interactive ‚Äî user approves login             |
| **Smart cards / YubiKeys** | Something you have | Hardware-based, strong assurance            |
| **Biometrics**         | Something you are   | Quick and increasingly common                 |
| **OTP tokens**         | Something you have  | Hardware fob that generates rotating code     |

## üîê MFA vs 2FA

| Term      | Definition                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2FA**   | Exactly **two** factors (e.g., password + OTP code)                         |
| **MFA**   | **Two or more** factors (can be 2FA, but could be 3+)                       |
| **SFA**   | **Single-Factor Authentication** (e.g., just a password)                    |

## üß† Benefits of MFA

- Blocks **over 99%** of automated credential attacks
- Protects remote access (VPN, RDP, cloud apps)
- Reduces risk from **phishing** and **keylogging**
- Enforces **zero trust principles**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MFA Weaknesses and Risks

| Threat                     | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **MFA fatigue**            | User repeatedly prompted and accidentally approves |
| **SIM swap / number porting** | Hijacks SMS-based codes                        |
| **Phishing proxies**       | Steal TOTP or push tokens in real time           |
| **Man-in-the-middle (MITM)** | Steal sessions after MFA                       |

> üì¢ MFA should be paired with **anti-phishing tools**, **session monitoring**, and **secure device posture**.
