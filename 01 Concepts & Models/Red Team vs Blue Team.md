**Red team vs Blue team** is a common cybersecurity exercise and operational model used to simulate real-world attacks and defenses. It involves an **offensive group (red)** attempting to compromise systems and a **defensive group (blue)** working to detect and stop them.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Red/Blue Teaming

- Assess and improve **incident detection and response**
- Identify **gaps in security controls**, logging, and alerts
- Train defenders in a realistic, adversarial environment
- Enhance **communication** between offense and defense
- Measure effectiveness of **tools, teams, and procedures**

> "The red team sharpens the sword; the blue team strengthens the shield."

## 🧱 Team Roles and Objectives

| Team        | Objective                                   | Methods Used                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🟥 **Red Team** | Simulate real-world attacks (adversary emulation) | Exploitation, pivoting, stealth, C2        |
| 🟦 **Blue Team**| Detect, defend, and respond to threats     | SIEM, firewalls, threat hunting, forensics |

---

## 🟥 Red Team Tactics

- Reconnaissance (OSINT, DNS, metadata)
- Initial access (phishing, exploit, credential stuffing)
- Privilege escalation (UAC bypass, token impersonation)
- Lateral movement (Pass-the-Hash, RDP, PsExec)
- Persistence (scheduled tasks, registry keys)
- Data exfiltration and impact (zip & upload, DNS tunneling)
- Evasion (living off the land, log tampering)

### 🔧 Tools

- Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, Mythic
- BloodHound, Mimikatz, SharpHound
- Custom scripts (Python, PowerShell, Bash)

---

## 🟦 Blue Team Tactics

- Log collection and SIEM analysis
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Threat hunting and anomaly detection
- Network segmentation and firewall tuning
- Incident response (containment, forensics)
- User training and phishing simulations

### 🛠 Tools

- Splunk, ELK Stack, Microsoft Sentinel
- CrowdStrike, Defender for Endpoint, Wazuh
- Wireshark, Velociraptor, GRR, OSQuery

## ⚖️ Purple Teaming

A **Purple Team** is a collaborative model where red and blue teams **work together** to improve detection and response capabilities.

| Red Team                         | Blue Team                          |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Tests systems via attack paths   | Monitors systems and alerts         |
| Provides adversarial insights    | Provides defense-in-depth context   |
| Validates security assumptions   | Enhances controls and logging       |
| Collaborates in purple team mode | Builds detections in real-time      |

---

## 🧠 Common Frameworks Used

- **MITRE ATT&CK** – Maps TTPs across red/blue engagements
- **Cyber Kill Chain** – Defines stages of attack lifecycle
- **Atomic Red Team** – Test small, reproducible attack techniques
- **Detection-as-Code** – Turn red insights into blue rules (e.g., Sigma)

## 📘 Example Scenario

| Phase                | Red Team Action                        | Blue Team Response                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Initial Access       | Phishing email with macro-enabled doc  | Email filter and SOC alert triggered |
| Privilege Escalation | UAC bypass via misconfigured service   | EDR alerts on unusual process tree   |
| Lateral Movement     | Pass-the-Hash to access file server    | SMB login anomaly in logs            |
| Exfiltration         | Zip + upload over HTTPS                | Traffic analysis, data exfil alert   |
