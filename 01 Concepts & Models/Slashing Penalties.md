> Slashing is a **punitive mechanism** in Proof of Stake (PoS) and related consensus models that **penalizes misbehaving validators** by confiscating part or all of their staked cryptocurrency.

## üìå Purpose of Slashing

- Enforces **honest behavior** in staking-based blockchains.
- Deters actions that could harm consensus or security.
- Maintains **network integrity** by holding validators economically accountable.

## üß† Key Concepts

| Term              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Validator**      | Node responsible for proposing and validating blocks in a PoS network       |
| **Stake**          | Cryptocurrency locked as collateral to participate in validation            |
| **Slashing**       | Penalty applied to stake due to misbehavior or protocol violations          |
| **Unbonding Period** | Time after withdrawing stake during which slashing may still apply       |

## üõ° Behaviors That Trigger Slashing

| Violation Type             | Description                                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Double Signing**          | Validator signs two conflicting blocks                     |
| **Surround Voting**         | Malicious vote that "surrounds" previous votes             |
| **Downtime/Inactivity**     | Validator fails to participate or is offline for long      |
| **Equivocation**            | Broadcasting contradictory messages to different peers     |
| **Unauthorized Block Proposals** | Submitting invalid or out-of-turn blocks              |

> Severity and slashing amount vary per blockchain.

## üí∏ Slashing Consequences

| Impact Type               | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Token Loss**             | Staked funds are partially or fully burned/confiscated       |
| **Validator Ejection**     | Misbehaving validator removed from active set                |
| **Reputation Loss**        | Impacts ability to be re-elected or delegated to             |
| **Delegator Risk**         | Delegators may also lose a portion of their stake            |

## ü™ô Examples by Blockchain

| Blockchain     | Slashable Offenses              | Penalty Range     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Ethereum 2.0** | Double signing, surround voting | Up to 100% of stake |
| **Polkadot**     | Downtime, equivocation          | 0.01% to 100%     |
| **Cosmos**       | Downtime, double signing        | 0.01% to 5%        |
| **Tezos**        | Misuse of delegated funds       | Slash + ban       |

## üß∞ Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy                | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Redundant Infrastructure** | Validators run backup nodes to ensure availability         |
| **Monitoring & Alerts** | Real-time notifications of performance issues                 |
| **Validator Reputation**| Community trust and history help reduce risk                  |
| **Multi-Signature & Custody Solutions** | Protect validator keys                        |
| **Slashing Insurance**  | Delegators and validators purchase slashing protection plans  |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Slashing vs Other Penalties

| Mechanism       | Focus                     | Examples                          |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Slashing**     | Punishment for malicious/erroneous behavior | Stake loss, ejection      |
| **Inactivity Penalty** | Reduced rewards for poor uptime        | Missed blocks, lower ROI   |
| **Slashing-free PoS** | Relies on reward incentives instead     | Algorand, Avalanche        |

## üß† Relevance

- Tied to **blockchain trust mechanisms**, **economic deterrents**, and **consensus enforcement**.
- Reinforces:
  - Accountability in decentralized systems
  - Incentive-based security models
  - Role of punitive measures in governance
