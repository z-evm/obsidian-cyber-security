|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Legacy Systems**             | Use outdated OS/software with no patch support               |
| **Flat Networks**              | Lack of segmentation ‚Üí lateral movement                      |
| **Real-Time Requirements**     | Cannot afford downtime or latency                            |
| **Lack of Encryption**         | Many protocols send data in plaintext                        |
| **Physical Access**            | Field devices are often unprotected                          |
| **Default Credentials**        | Hardcoded usernames/passwords in control components          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management Considerations

- **Zero Trust for ICS**: All communication and access must be verified.
- **Change Management**: Strict controls for configuration updates.
- **Availability is Critical**: Must prioritize uptime over aggressive scanning.
- **Vendor Coordination**: Work closely with ICS vendors for patching and hardening.
