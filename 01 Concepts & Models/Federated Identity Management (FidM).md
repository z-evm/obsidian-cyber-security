Federated Identity Management (FIdM) enables users to access multiple systems or services across trust boundaries using a **single identity**. It establishes trust relationships between different organizations or domains, allowing seamless authentication and user experience.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

| Term                 | Definition |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Identity Provider (IdP)** | The system that authenticates a user and provides identity assertions (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google). |
| **Service Provider (SP)**   | The system that consumes the identity assertion to authorize access (e.g., Salesforce, Dropbox). |
| **Assertion**               | A trusted statement used to prove a user’s identity, usually transmitted in formats like SAML or JWT. |
| **Trust Relationship**      | A pre-established agreement between IdP and SP enabling secure exchange of authentication data. |

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User attempts to access** a Service Provider (SP).
2. SP **redirects the user** to their Identity Provider (IdP).
3. IdP **authenticates the user** (password, MFA, etc.).
4. IdP sends a **signed assertion/token** back to the SP.
5. SP grants access based on the user identity and roles.

## 🧱 Technologies Involved

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** | XML-based protocol used in many enterprise SSO systems. |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Authorization framework used for token-based access between applications. |
| **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** | Built on OAuth 2.0, adds authentication layer using JWTs. |

## ✅ Benefits

- 🔐 **Stronger Security** — Reduces password sprawl and centralizes authentication.
- 🧑‍💼 **Better User Experience** — Seamless SSO across services.
- 📉 **Reduced Admin Overhead** — No need for separate user accounts per service.
- 🌐 **Cross-Organizational Access** — Useful in mergers, B2B, and cloud integrations.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- 📄 Requires robust **legal and technical trust agreements** between entities.
- 🔄 Complexity in **managing federated trust relationships**.
- 🛡️ IdP compromise affects all connected SPs — requires hardened security at the IdP.

## 🗂 Use Cases

- 🔁 **Single Sign-On (SSO)** across multiple SaaS platforms.
- 🏥 **Healthcare** sharing patient data across different providers.
- 🎓 **University consortiums** sharing access to educational resources.
- 🏢 **Enterprise Mergers** where multiple identity domains need to interoperate.
