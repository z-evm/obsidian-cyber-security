**Vulnerability Scanning Automation** refers to the use of scripts, schedulers, APIs, and orchestration tools to streamline the continuous discovery and assessment of security weaknesses across systems, applications, and networks.

This practice enhances security posture by enabling **proactive detection**, **faster remediation**, and **integration with DevSecOps pipelines**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform regular scans **without manual intervention**
- Integrate scanning into **CI/CD pipelines**
- Quickly identify and report vulnerabilities
- Support compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)
- Reduce operational overhead in vulnerability management

## 🔁 Automation Workflow Overview

***Asset Discovery*** *→* ***Scheduled or Triggered Scan*** *→* ***Analysis*** *→* ***Report/Alert*** *→* ***Ticket/Action***

## 🛠 Common Tools for Automated Scanning

|Tool / Platform|Notes|
|---|---|
|**Nessus / Tenable.io**|Enterprise-grade scanning + API support|
|**OpenVAS / Greenbone**|Free, open-source scanner with scripting options|
|**Qualys**|SaaS-based scanner with automation and asset inventory|
|**Nikto / Nmap**|Lightweight tools for targeted automation|
|**Burp Suite Pro**|Web app scanning via CLI & extensions|
|**ZAP (OWASP)**|Free web app scanner with built-in automation hooks|
|**GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**|Automate scans during build/deploy phases|

---

## 🧰 Automation Methods

### 1. 🗓 Cron Jobs & Scheduling
```
# Run Nessus CLI scan daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /opt/nessus/nessuscli scan run --policy="Baseline Scan" --target=192.168.1.0/24
```

### 2. 📡 API-Driven Scanning

- Use **Nessus REST API**, **Tenable.io API**, **Qualys API** to:
    - Launch scans
    - Pull scan results
    - Export reports
    - Trigger scans on asset changes

### 3. 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline Integration

- Embed scanners like **ZAP**, **Trivy**, or **Snyk** into pipelines:
```
# GitHub Actions Example (Trivy)
- name: Run Trivy scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: 'myapp:latest'
```

### 4. 📑 Output & Reporting Automation

- Generate scan reports in:
    - HTML / PDF / JSON / CSV
- Auto-send via:
    - Email, Slack, Teams
    - Integration with **SIEM**, **Jira**, or **ServiceNow**

## 🔐 Security Considerations

|Concern|Mitigation|
|---|---|
|**Scan Authentication**|Use credentialed scans with vault integration|
|**Scan Noise**|Schedule off-hours or throttle frequency|
|**Data Sensitivity**|Restrict access to scan logs and reports|
|**Resource Impact**|Avoid scanning production systems at peak hours|

---

## 🔄 Post-Scan Automation Options

|Action|Automation Tool|
|---|---|
|Create remediation tickets|Jira API, ServiceNow workflows|
|Trigger playbooks|SOAR platforms (e.g., Cortex XSOAR)|
|Notify security teams|Slack bots, email alerts, SIEM|
|Auto-patch (with approval)|SCCM, Ansible, WSUS|

---

## 📊 Scan Frequency Guidelines (NIST / PCI-DSS)

|Asset Type|Recommended Frequency|
|---|---|
|External-Facing Systems|Weekly or after any change|
|Internal Infrastructure|Monthly to Quarterly|
|Web Applications|Every deployment or monthly|
|Critical Assets|Weekly or continuous scanning|
