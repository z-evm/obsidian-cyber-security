The **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)** is a structured process that integrates **security practices into each phase of software development**, ensuring that applications are built to resist threats from the start.

> “Shift security left” — find and fix vulnerabilities early, not after deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of SDL

- 🔒 Build secure software from the ground up
- 🧪 Reduce vulnerabilities and risk exposure
- 📜 Ensure regulatory and compliance requirements are met
- 🔁 Integrate security into agile or DevOps workflows

## 🧱 Key SDL Phases

| Phase                  | Security Focus |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **1. Requirements**     | Identify security requirements, compliance needs (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). |
| **2. Design**           | Apply threat modeling and secure architecture principles. |
| **3. Implementation**   | Use secure coding practices and peer reviews. |
| **4. Testing**          | Perform static/dynamic analysis, fuzzing, and penetration testing. |
| **5. Deployment**       | Secure configuration, patch readiness, CI/CD integration. |
| **6. Maintenance**      | Ongoing vulnerability management and incident response readiness. |

## 🔍 Security Activities by Phase

### 📋 Requirements
- Define security features (authentication, access control)
- Determine compliance scope (PCI DSS, ISO 27001)

### 🧠 Design
- Perform **threat modeling** (STRIDE, DREAD)
- Define **security architecture**
- Conduct design reviews

### 💻 Implementation
- Follow **secure coding standards** (e.g., OWASP)
- Use **code signing** and **version control**
- Integrate **code linting and scanning tools**

### 🧪 Testing
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **IAST**: Interactive App Security Testing
- Manual **penetration testing**

### 🚀 Deployment
- Use **least privilege** principles
- Harden containers, servers, and infrastructure
- Automate **security tests** in CI/CD

### 🔁 Maintenance
- Monitor logs and vulnerabilities
- Patch frequently and track software inventory
- Respond to incidents with forensics-ready design
