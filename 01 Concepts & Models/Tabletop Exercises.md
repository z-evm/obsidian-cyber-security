**Tabletop Exercises (TTX)** are discussion-based simulations used to evaluate and improve an organization’s incident response capabilities. These exercises allow teams to walk through scenarios in a structured environment without operational disruption.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Validate the **incident response plan (IRP)** and communication flows
- Identify **gaps in roles, tools, and decision-making**
- Improve **cross-functional coordination**
- Reinforce **compliance** with NIST, ISO, and regulatory requirements
- Promote a **culture of preparedness** and continuous improvement

## 🧠 What Happens in a Tabletop?

> A facilitator presents a simulated cyber incident (e.g., ransomware attack). Participants react in real-time by discussing their roles, decisions, and next steps based on the existing IR plan.

## 🧰 Common Tabletop Scenarios

| Scenario Type         | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Ransomware**          | Simulate encryption of internal systems            |
| **Phishing Campaign**   | Mass credential harvesting with email compromise   |
| **Insider Threat**      | Employee accesses sensitive data inappropriately   |
| **DDoS Attack**         | Simulated outage from external flooding            |
| **Data Breach**         | Exfiltration of customer PII or financial records |
| **Cloud Misconfiguration** | Public S3 bucket exposure or IAM over-permissioning |

## 📋 Tabletop Flow

1. *Pre-Planning*
   - Define objectives
   - Select scenario
   - Invite participants
   - Set rules of engagement

1. *Execution*
   - Facilitator presents scenario
   - Participants respond based on current IR procedures
   - Injects and escalations simulate evolving threats

1. *Debrief*
   - Identify gaps or confusion
   - Document timeline, decisions, and outcomes
   - Recommend improvements

1. *Report & Remediation*
   - Finalize findings
   - Update IR documentation
   - Plan follow-up exercises

## 🛡️ Benefits of TTX

- No operational impact (non-disruptive)
- Encourages strategic and critical thinking
- Improves communication across departments
- Builds muscle memory for real incidents
- Uncovers blind spots before real damage occurs

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Simulated (not technical or hands-on)
- May suffer from unrealistic assumptions or constraints
- Requires skilled facilitation for maximum value

---

## 🔐 Compliance & Standards Alignment

- **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** – Incident Response
- **ISO/IEC 27035** – Information Security Incident Management
- **PCI DSS** – IR testing is required annually
- **CIS Control 17.5** – Conduct routine incident response exercises
