**Rules of Engagement (RoE)** define the formal agreement between a testing team (e.g., penetration testers or red team) and the organization being assessed. RoEs establish the **scope, limitations, responsibilities, and legal protections** surrounding a cybersecurity assessment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of RoE

- ✅ Set **clear expectations** and boundaries for all parties
- ⚖️ Ensure **legal authorization** and minimize liability
- 🛡️ Protect systems, data, and personnel during testing
- 📋 Document **testing scope**, schedule, targets, and escalation protocols

## 🧱 Core Components of a RoE

| Component                 | Description                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope of Engagement**    | Clearly defined systems, applications, networks, and services to test    |
| **Testing Window**         | Start/end times, allowed testing hours (e.g., off-peak only)            |
| **Targets (In-Scope/Out-of-Scope)** | Assets explicitly allowed or prohibited from testing            |
| **Methodologies Permitted**| Types of tests allowed (e.g., phishing, DoS, social engineering)        |
| **Tools and Payload Restrictions** | Limit use of destructive or potentially unstable tools           |
| **Data Handling Guidelines** | How sensitive data will be protected, stored, and disposed of         |
| **Communication Plan**     | Points of contact, escalation steps, and reporting timelines            |
| **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**   | Pre-approved emergency procedures for unintended disruption             |
| **Legal Authorization**    | Signed agreement authorizing the testing (often required for legality) |

---

## 🔐 Authorization & Consent

- **Written consent** is required before any testing begins
- Ensure **senior management sign-off** is included
- Defines **liability limitations** for the testing team

> 🔔 Without proper authorization, penetration testing may be considered **illegal hacking**.

## 🧪 Example Restrictions in RoE

| Prohibited Activity         | Reason                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Denial-of-Service (DoS)     | May crash production systems                     |
| Social Engineering Attacks  | May affect employee morale or trust              |
| Attacking Out-of-Scope Assets | Can violate data regulations or 3rd-party terms |
| Data Exfiltration           | Risk of data leakage or exposure                 |

## 📊 RoE vs Scope of Work (SoW)

| Document      | Purpose                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **RoE**        | Defines **how** testing will be conducted |
| **SoW**        | Defines **what** will be tested (targets) |

Both documents are typically required and complementary.

## 🧰 When Are RoEs Used?

- 🛠 Penetration tests (internal, external, web, mobile)
- 🕵️‍♂️ Red team operations and adversary simulations
- 🎯 Bug bounty programs and ethical hacking engagements
- 🔄 Third-party security assessments

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Draft and review RoE collaboratively with client stakeholders
- Include **escalation procedures** and **emergency contacts**
- Version and archive all signed RoE documents
- Match RoE with applicable **compliance** frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-115)
- Perform a **post-engagement review** to assess adherence

---

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

- Clearly define **jurisdiction**, **data ownership**, and **breach handling**
- Include **non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)** to protect findings
- Determine **liability limitations** for unintentional damage
- Identify **regulatory requirements** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
