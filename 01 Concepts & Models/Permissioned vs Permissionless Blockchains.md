## üìå Core Differences

| Feature                 | Permissioned Blockchain                          | Permissionless Blockchain                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**        | Restricted ‚Äî Only authorized nodes can join     | Open ‚Äî Anyone can join and participate         |
| **Identity**              | Known and vetted (PKI, MSP)                     | Anonymous or pseudonymous                      |
| **Consensus Mechanism**   | Efficient (e.g., PBFT, Raft)                    | Resource-intensive (e.g., PoW, PoS)            |
| **Governance**            | Centralized or consortium-based                 | Decentralized, community-driven                |
| **Transaction Speed**     | High throughput, low latency                    | Slower due to network and consensus overhead   |
| **Data Visibility**       | Fine-grained, private channels possible         | Fully public or pseudonymous                   |
| **Smart Contracts**       | Custom, role-aware logic                        | Open programmable contracts                    |
| **Use Case Fit**          | Enterprise, finance, supply chain               | Cryptocurrency, open finance (DeFi), NFTs      |

## üß† Permissioned Blockchain Overview

- Participants are **pre-approved** and **identified**.
- Suitable for **private consortia** or **regulated industries**.
- Example platforms:
  - **Hyperledger Fabric**
  - **R3 Corda**
  - **Quorum (private Ethereum variant)**

### üîê Security Features

| Control Type      | Example                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control** | Role-based, certificate-based via MSP or PKI            |
| **Private Channels** | Subnets for confidential communication                 |
| **Pluggable Consensus** | Faster protocols like PBFT, Raft                    |

## üåê Permissionless Blockchain Overview

- **Open to all**: anyone can read, write, and validate.
- High **transparency** and **censorship resistance**.
- Example platforms:
  - **Bitcoin**
  - **Ethereum (mainnet)**
  - **Litecoin, Solana, Cardano**

### ‚öîÔ∏è Security Features

| Mechanism        | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PoW / PoS**     | Protects against Sybil and 51% attacks                     |
| **Economic Incentives** | Honest behavior rewarded; malicious penalized      |
| **Decentralization** | Reduces reliance on any single authority              |

| Category                | Permissioned                     | Permissionless                    |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Participation**        | By invitation or access policy    | Open to public                    |
| **Trust Model**          | Trust between known parties       | Trustless, cryptographic          |
| **Performance**          | High (fewer nodes, efficient consensus) | Moderate to low                 |
| **Energy Consumption**   | Low                              | Potentially high (PoW)            |
| **Privacy & Compliance** | High, regulatory alignment       | Public ledger, limited privacy    |
| **Upgrade Agility**      | Faster (centralized control)     | Slower, community consensus needed|
| **Example Use Cases**    | Supply chains, banking, logistics | Cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs        |
