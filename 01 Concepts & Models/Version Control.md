**Version Control** is the practice of tracking and managing changes to files, code, configurations, and documentation over time. It enables collaboration, **auditability**, **rollback**, and **change integrity** in both software development and IT infrastructure environments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Version Control

- 📦 Track **changes** over time to files or systems
- 🔄 Allow **rollback** to previous versions when needed
- 🧾 Maintain an **audit trail** for compliance and debugging
- 👥 Support **collaborative development** and change management
- 🔐 Enforce **change control** in secure environments

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term             | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Repository**    | Central storage of files and their history                |
| **Commit**        | A recorded snapshot of changes                            |
| **Branch**        | An independent line of development                        |
| **Merge**         | Integrate changes from one branch into another            |
| **Pull Request**  | Propose and review changes before integration             |
| **Tag/Release**   | Mark a specific commit as a stable version                |
| **Diff**          | Show differences between versions                         |

## 📦 Types of Version Control Systems

| Type              | Description                                       | Example Tools               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Local VCS**     | Track changes on a single machine                 | RCS                         |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | Central server stores all changes           | SVN, Perforce               |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Each user has a full copy of repo/history | Git, Mercurial              |

> ✅ **Git** is the most widely used DVCS today, powering platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## 🔐 Version Control & Security

- 🔐 Protect repositories with **access controls** and **MFA**
- 🧾 Maintain **commit logs** for accountability and forensics
- 🕵️ Scan for **secrets accidentally committed** (e.g., API keys, passwords)
- ✅ Use **signed commits/tags** for integrity and non-repudiation
- 🚨 Monitor for unauthorized or suspicious changes

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms

| Tool / Platform        | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Git**                | Distributed version control system     |
| **GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket** | Hosted collaboration and CI/CD |
| **Subversion (SVN)**   | Centralized system, still used in legacy ops |
| **Azure Repos**        | Git and TFVC support with Azure DevOps |
| **Mercurial**          | Alternative to Git (less common today) |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 📋 Commit small, **atomic changes** with meaningful messages
- 🔀 Use **branching strategies** (e.g., Git Flow, trunk-based development)
- 🔐 Enforce **code reviews** and pull requests for critical environments
- 🧹 Regularly **cleanup stale branches** and refactor commit history when needed
- 🧾 Integrate version control with **CI/CD and IaC workflows**

---

## 🧪 Version Control in Infrastructure & Security

- 🛠 Track changes in:
  - Firewall rules
  - Configuration files
  - IaC code (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation)
- 📊 Compare system baselines
- 🔁 Rollback security changes if a misconfiguration occurs
- 🧠 Demonstrate compliance for audits (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
