> Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a consensus algorithm designed to tolerate **Byzantine faults** ‚Äî including malicious or faulty nodes ‚Äî in distributed systems, especially **permissioned blockchains**.

---

## üìå What Is PBFT?

- Solves the **Byzantine Generals Problem** in practical, real-world networks.
- Enables consensus even if up to **1/3 of nodes are faulty or malicious**.
- Designed for **low-latency**, **high-throughput**, and **permissioned environments**.

> Developed by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov (1999).

## üß† Core Properties

| Property        | Description                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deterministic**| Guarantees finality ‚Äî once agreed, a decision is permanent      |
| **Leader-Based** | One node acts as the primary (proposer), others as backups      |
| **View Changes** | Faulty leaders can be replaced via view-change protocol         |
| **Resilience**   | Tolerates up to **f** faulty nodes with **n ‚â• 3f + 1**          |

## üîÅ PBFT Protocol Phases

1. **Pre-Prepare**: Primary proposes a request to replicas.
2. **Prepare**: Replicas broadcast prepared messages to others.
3. **Commit**: If enough replicas agree, the request is committed.
4. **Reply**: Nodes send response to the client.

### ‚úÖ Finality:
- Achieved after **2f + 1** agreeing messages.
- No forks or probabilistic settlement like in PoW.

## üß† PBFT vs Other Consensus Algorithms

| Feature                | PBFT                              | PoW                                | PoS                                  |

| **Finality**            | Deterministic (guaranteed)        | Probabilistic                       | Depends on chain                     |
| **Scalability**         | Low in large networks             | High (with trade-offs)              | Moderate (depends on design)         |
| **Byzantine Resilience**| Yes (up to 1/3 faulty)            | Indirect (economic deterrent)       | Yes (with slashing penalties)        |
| **Energy Use**          | Very low                          | Very high                           | Low                                  |
| **Use Case Fit**        | Private/consortium blockchains    | Public, permissionless networks     | Hybrid (public or permissioned)      |
