A **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** is a formal, machine-readable inventory of all components, libraries, and dependencies included in a software package. It serves as a **supply chain transparency tool** that allows organizations to identify, track, and assess the security of software components.

---

## üéØ Purpose of an SBOM

- Identify **vulnerabilities** in dependencies (e.g., Log4Shell)
- Improve **incident response** and patch prioritization
- Enable **compliance** with standards like NIST, EO 14028
- Support **secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)**
- Increase **transparency** between software producers and consumers

## üîê SBOM and Security

- Supports **vulnerability disclosure** by mapping CVEs to components  
- Essential for **zero-day triage** when CVEs are announced  
- Enables **automated risk scoring** via tools like OSV, NVD, or Snyk  
- Improves **secure software supply chain posture**
