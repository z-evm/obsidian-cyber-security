A **Vendor Security Assessment** is the structured process of evaluating a third-party provider's **information security posture**, **compliance level**, and **risk impact** before or during a business relationship. It is a key component of **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** and **Supply Chain Security**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Identify **cybersecurity risks** introduced by third-party vendors  
- Ensure alignment with **compliance standards** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIST)  
- Validate vendors follow **secure practices** for handling sensitive data  
- Support **risk-based decision-making** for onboarding or renewal
