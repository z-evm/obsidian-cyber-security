**Secure Boot** is a security standard developed by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) to ensure that a system boots using **only software that is trusted and signed** by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or trusted authorities.

It provides a **hardware-rooted trust chain** that protects the boot process from **rootkits**, **bootkits**, and **firmware-level threats**.

## üéØ Purpose of Secure Boot

- Prevent execution of **unauthorized bootloaders**, OS kernels, and drivers
- Ensure **system integrity** from the moment the device powers on
- Block **pre-OS malware** that can persist undetected
- Enforce a **trusted boot process** with cryptographic verification

---

## üîê How Secure Boot Works

1. **UEFI firmware** verifies the digital signature of the bootloader.
2. If trusted, the bootloader is executed; if not, boot fails or halts.
3. The bootloader verifies the **OS kernel**, which in turn verifies drivers.
4. Each stage verifies the next ‚Äî forming a **chain of trust**.

## üß† Key Concepts

| Term                     | Description                                                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UEFI**                  | Modern firmware interface that replaces legacy BIOS                 |
| **PK (Platform Key)**     | Authorizes updates to Secure Boot keys                              |
| **KEK (Key Exchange Key)**| Allows UEFI to validate trusted DB/DBX updates                      |
| **DB (Allowed Signatures)**| List of trusted certificates and hashes                            |
| **DBX (Revoked Signatures)**| List of blacklisted signatures (malware, outdated software)      |

## üß∞ Use Cases

| Scenario                            | How Secure Boot Helps                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventing Bootkits/Rootkits**     | Blocks unsigned or tampered bootloaders                    |
| **Compliance in Enterprise Environments** | Ensures only validated OS images are used           |
| **Trusted OS Deployments**           | Enforces whitelisted kernel and driver execution           |
| **System Recovery Integrity**        | Verifies trusted recovery media during startup             |

## üîç Verification Flow

```
UEFI Firmware ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Bootloader ‚îÄ‚îÄ> OS Kernel ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Drivers  
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ  
(Signed) (Signed) (Signed) (Signed)
```


Each component is cryptographically validated before execution.

## üß™ Secure Boot vs Measured Boot

| Feature            | Secure Boot                        | Measured Boot                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Enforces execution of trusted code | Records integrity measurements          |
| **Verification**   | Cryptographic signature checking   | TPM-based PCR logging                   |
| **Focus**          | **Prevention**                     | **Detection** and auditability          |
| **Component**      | UEFI + Signature Databases         | TPM + Boot Process Measurement          |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

- Protects against **bootkits**, **UEFI malware**, and **unauthorized OS**
- Supports **BitLocker integrity check**
- Enables **compliance** with secure computing standards (e.g., NIST 800-147)
- Forms foundation of **Zero Trust** device boot validation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

- Must be enabled in **BIOS/UEFI firmware**
- May require signing custom bootloaders or drivers (e.g., in Linux distros)
- Can cause boot issues with dual-boot or legacy systems
- Attackers may attempt to **disable Secure Boot** via BIOS password bypass or firmware exploits

---

## üß∞ Management Tools (Windows)

- BIOS/UEFI interface: Enable/disable Secure Boot
- PowerShell: `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`
- BitLocker: Uses Secure Boot + TPM to verify boot integrity
- Group Policy: Configure boot policy for enterprise deployment
