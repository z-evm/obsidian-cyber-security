**Redundancy models** are strategies used to ensure **system availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **business continuity** by duplicating critical components or systems. These models help eliminate single points of failure and reduce downtime.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure **high availability** and **resilience**.
- Minimize impact of **hardware failures**, **network outages**, or **data loss**.
- Enable **failover**, **load balancing**, and **disaster recovery**.
- Meet recovery and uptime goals (RTO, RPO, SLA requirements).

| **Load Balancing**      | Evenly distributes traffic or load among multiple systems     |
| **Microservices Redundancy** | Stateless components deployed in parallel for scaling and failover |
| **DNS Round-Robin**     | Cycles through multiple A records for basic redundancy       |

## üîÅ Redundancy Architecture Models

| Model                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active-Active**          | All redundant nodes run simultaneously and share load.                      |
| **Active-Passive**         | One node is on standby and only takes over if the primary fails.            |
| **N+1**                    | For every N primary components, there is 1 backup.                          |
| **2N**                     | Full duplication ‚Äî two completely mirrored systems.                         |
| **Grid/Clustered**         | Pool of interconnected nodes for workload distribution and failover.        |

## üß† Considerations for Redundancy Design

- **Criticality of the system or data**
- **Cost vs. benefit** (e.g., 2N is expensive but robust)
- **Latency and location** (important in geo-redundancy)
- **Maintenance windows and switchover time**
- **SLA/Uptime requirements** (e.g., 99.9% vs 99.999%)

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Conduct **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** to guide redundancy needs.
- Combine **redundancy with regular backup** ‚Äî they‚Äôre not the same.
- Regularly **test failover mechanisms** (fire drills, simulations).
- Integrate with **monitoring tools** to detect and react to failures.
- Document and automate **switchover and restoration procedures**.
