**Asset Inventory** is the comprehensive cataloging of all hardware, software, data, and virtual assets within an organization. It forms the foundation for **risk management**, **incident response**, and **security control implementation**.

---

## üéØ Purpose of Asset Inventory

- Understand **what needs protection**
- Identify **vulnerable or unauthorized assets**
- Support **patch management** and **vulnerability scanning**
- Enable **access control**, **data classification**, and **compliance**
- Respond effectively to **incidents or breaches**

> "You can't protect what you don't know you have."
