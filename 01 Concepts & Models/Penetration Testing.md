**Penetration Testing (Pentesting)** is the authorized simulation of real-world cyberattacks against systems, applications, or networks to **identify and exploit vulnerabilities**. Its goal is to evaluate security posture and demonstrate impact before real attackers can.

---

## üéØ Objectives of Pentesting

- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities
- Validate effectiveness of security controls
- Assess risk exposure of critical systems
- Demonstrate real-world attack impact
- Support compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)

> Pentesting is often part of a broader **red team** assessment or annual security audit.

## üß± Pentest Methodology

| Phase                  | Description                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Planning & Scoping** | Define objectives, scope, rules of engagement       |
| **2. Reconnaissance**      | Passive and active info gathering                  |
| **3. Scanning & Enumeration** | Identify live hosts, open ports, services     |
| **4. Exploitation**        | Gain access via known vulnerabilities             |
| **5. Post-Exploitation**   | Escalate privileges, pivot, access sensitive data  |
| **6. Reporting**           | Document findings, risk ratings, and remediation   |

## üì¶ Types of Penetration Tests

| Type           | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **External**    | Targets internet-facing assets (web servers, VPNs)   |
| **Internal**    | Simulates attacker inside the LAN (e.g., rogue employee) |
| **Web Application** | Focused on websites and APIs (XSS, SQLi, auth flaws) |
| **Wireless**    | Attacks Wi-Fi, rogue APs, WEP/WPA flaws              |
| **Physical**    | Tests physical security (badge spoofing, tailgating) |
| **Social Engineering** | Phishing, pretexting, phone calls              |

- Vulnerability scanning and CVE research

---

## üìò Example Engagement: Web App Pentest

1. **Recon** ‚Äì Enumerate subdomains and endpoints  
2. **Scanning** ‚Äì Identify login panel, test HTTP methods  
3. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Find and exploit SQL injection  
4. **Privilege Escalation** ‚Äì Gain admin access via logic flaw  
5. **Data Extraction** ‚Äì Dump user database  
6. **Report** ‚Äì Document chain and suggest mitigations

## üìÑ Pentesting Certifications

| Cert             | Description                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **OSCP**         | Practical, exploit-focused exam by OffSec |
| **eJPT/eCPPT**   | Entry-level to mid-level from INE   |
| **CEH**          | Theoretical cert from EC-Council    |
| **GPEN**         | GIAC cert with SANS training focus  |
| **CRTP/CRTE**    | Windows AD-specific pentesting      |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Always have a **signed authorization (Rules of Engagement)**
- Follow **responsible disclosure** if zero-days are found
- Avoid causing harm, data loss, or violating scope
- Log all activities for transparency and reporting

---

## üîê Defensive Response

- **Blue teams** use logs, SIEM, and behavior analytics to detect pentests
- Segregate test traffic in lab environments when possible
- Use red team findings to improve:
  - Patch cycles
  - Monitoring and alerting
  - Security awareness
