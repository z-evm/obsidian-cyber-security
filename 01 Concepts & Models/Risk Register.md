A **Risk Register** is a structured document or system used to record, track, and manage identified risks. It helps security teams, auditors, and decision-makers monitor threats, plan mitigation strategies, and prioritize resources.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Document identified risks and vulnerabilities.
- Assess likelihood and impact of each risk.
- Track status, ownership, and mitigation efforts.
- Support ongoing **risk assessments**, **audits**, and **authorization** decisions.
