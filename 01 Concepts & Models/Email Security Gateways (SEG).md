A **Secure Email Gateway (SEG)** is a specialized security solution that sits between external email sources and internal mail servers, providing **advanced filtering, threat detection, and compliance enforcement**. SEGs are essential for defending against email-based attacks such as phishing, malware, spam, and data exfiltration.

## 🎯 What Is a SEG?

**Definition:**  
A **Secure Email Gateway (SEG)** is an appliance or cloud-based service that monitors and filters **inbound and outbound email** to protect users and organizations from email-borne threats.

**Placement in Infrastructure:**
##### Internet 🌐 → SEG 🔐 → Mail Server (e.g., Microsoft 365, Exchange)

## 🔁 Inbound vs Outbound Protections

| Direction   | Protections Applied                                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inbound** | Spam/phishing filtering, malware detection, authentication |
| **Outbound**| DLP, encryption, policy checks, compliance logging          |

## 🔐 Identity Validation with SPF/DKIM/DMARC

Most SEGs integrate with email authentication standards:

- **SPF** – Verifies sending server's IP
- **DKIM** – Verifies content integrity and domain identity
- **DMARC** – Provides policy and reporting for domain-level protection

See: [[SPF, DKIM, DMARC]]

## ⚙️ Deployment Models

- **On-Premises Appliance**
- **Cloud-Hosted SEG (SaaS)**
- **Hybrid**

> ✅ Cloud SEGs are now preferred for scalability, easier updates, and M365/Gmail integration.

## 📉 Limitations & Considerations

- May **not detect zero-days** without sandboxing
- **False positives** can interrupt business email flow
- Requires **regular tuning** and policy updates
- May need **integration with DLP/SIEM** for full context
