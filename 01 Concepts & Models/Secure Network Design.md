**Secure Network Design** involves structuring networks to **minimize attack surfaces**, **control access**, and **contain breaches** through layered defenses, segmentation, and policy enforcement. It is a foundational element of **defense in depth**.

---

## 🎯 Goals of Secure Network Design

- Protect **critical assets** from unauthorized access
- Enable **visibility**, **control**, and **containment**
- Enforce **least privilege** and **segmentation**
- Support regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST)

## 🧱 Core Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Defense in Depth**      | Layered controls (firewall + IDS + auth + AV)   |
| **Least Privilege**       | Only required access to systems/services        |
| **Segmentation**          | Isolate networks based on risk and function     |
| **Zero Trust**            | Trust nothing by default; verify every session  |
| **Fail-Secure Defaults**  | Block access unless explicitly permitted        |

## 🌐 Network Segmentation

Segmenting the network limits lateral movement and exposure.

| Zone                  | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **DMZ**               | Public-facing services (e.g., web server)     |
| **Internal LAN**      | End-user systems                             |
| **Secure Zone**       | Critical systems (e.g., DBs, domain controllers) |
| **Guest VLAN**        | Internet-only access for unmanaged devices    |
| **Management Network**| For network admin access (SSH, SNMP, RDP)     |

> Use VLANs, firewalls, and ACLs to enforce boundaries.

## 🔐 Key Security Components

| Component               | Function                                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Firewalls**            | Filter traffic at network boundaries           |
| **NAC (802.1X)**         | Control device access to switch ports/Wi-Fi    |
| **IDS/IPS**              | Detect/prevent malicious traffic               |
| **VPN Gateways**         | Secure remote access                           |
| **Proxy / Web Filters**  | Control and inspect outbound traffic           |
| **Load Balancers**       | Isolate backend apps and improve availability  |
| **Jump Boxes / Bastion Hosts** | Secure remote admin access           |

## 🔄 Typical Design Patterns

### 🧭 1. **DMZ Design**

***Internet*** ─▶ ***Firewall*** ─▶ ***DMZ*** ─▶ ***Internal Firewall*** ─▶ ***LAN****/****Servers***

- DMZ hosts: Web server, mail relay, reverse proxy
- Blocks direct access to internal network

---

### 🧭 2. **Zero Trust Segmentation**

- No implicit trust between subnets
- Authentication + authorization at every layer
- Microsegmentation with granular policies (e.g., via SDN or firewalls)

---

### 🧭 3. **Hub-and-Spoke VPN Topology**

- Remote users connect to central VPN hub
- Branch sites route traffic through central data center

---

## 🔍 Monitoring and Visibility

- Enable **NetFlow** / IPFIX for traffic analysis
- Use **SIEM** for log correlation across:
    - Firewalls
    - EDRs
    - DNS/DHCP
- Monitor for:
    - East-west traffic spikes
    - Suspicious DNS, port scans, or lateral movement

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- ✅ Harden routers, firewalls, and switches (disable unused services)
- ✅ Disable unused ports and protocols
- ✅ Use **MFA** for admin access
- ✅ Enforce **strong ACLs** and firewall rules
- ✅ Keep **management plane isolated** from user LAN
- ✅ Regularly test with **network vulnerability scanners** (e.g., Nessus, Nmap)
