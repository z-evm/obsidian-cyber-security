The **FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) Strategy Guide** provides the framework for how Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) maintain their security posture and **Authorization to Operate (ATO)** through routine monitoring, vulnerability management, and reporting to FedRAMP-authorizing entities (JAB or agencies).

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure CSPs **continuously assess and mitigate risk** after authorization.
- Detect and respond to system changes that may affect security.
- Maintain **trust and transparency** between CSPs and federal customers.
- Comply with FedRAMP's **ongoing authorization** requirements.

## üß± Core ConMon Requirements

| Requirement                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vulnerability Scanning**   | Monthly internal/external OS and web app scans (authenticated).             |
| **Inventory Reporting**      | Monthly submission of hardware/software inventory.                         |
| **POA&M Updates**            | Monthly remediation tracking of open vulnerabilities.                      |
| **Significant Change Reporting** | Notify FedRAMP PMO within 30 days of major changes.                    |
| **Annual Assessment**        | 3PAO conducts full reassessment of a subset of controls.                   |
| **Incident Reporting**       | Notify US-CERT and FedRAMP within **1 hour** for confirmed major incidents.|

---

## üóì Monthly Submission Package

CSPs must submit the following each month to their authorizing agency or JAB reviewers:

1. **Vulnerability Scan Results**
   - External, Internal, Web App (scanned via FedRAMP-approved tools).
2. **Updated POA&M**
   - Reflects status, remediation dates, responsible parties, severity.
3. **Change Log**
   - List of system changes (e.g., patches, deployments, architecture).
4. **Inventory Lists**
   - Up-to-date hardware/software inventories, with change details.
5. **Scan Execution Details**
   - IP ranges, scan accounts, tools used, scan completion timestamps.

## üõ† Vulnerability Management Guidelines

| Vulnerability Severity | Remediation Deadline |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Critical**            | Within 30 calendar days |
| **High**                | Within 30 calendar days |
| **Moderate**            | Within 90 calendar days |
| **Low**                 | Track, but no strict timeline |

‚ö†Ô∏è Failure to meet timelines must be documented in the POA&M with justification.

---

## üîÑ Annual Assessment Activities

- Performed by an accredited **3PAO**.
- Test a subset of FedRAMP controls based on system impact level.
- Refresh artifacts:
  - [[Security Assessment Report (SAR)]]
  - [[System Security Plan (SSP)]]
  - Updated POA&M entries

---

## üõë Significant Change Examples

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) modifications
- Migration to a new CSP or region
- Major security tooling upgrades (e.g., new SIEM or firewall)
- New external connections or API gateways

> CSPs must submit a **Significant Change Request** and update documentation (SSP, diagrams, etc.)

- [FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Performance Management Guide (v2.3)](https://www.fedramp.gov)
- FedRAMP Monthly ConMon Templates
- FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form
- NIST SP 800-137 ‚Äì ISCM Guidance
- FedRAMP System Security Plan Template

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Automate scans, inventory collection, and POA&M tracking.
- Conduct **internal patch audits** weekly or bi-weekly.
- Monitor cloud-native services for drift or change events (e.g., AWS Config).
- Integrate with incident response and change management workflows.
- Use dashboards for **real-time ConMon metrics** (RPOs, patch SLAs, risk trends).
