A **Secure Web Gateway (SWG)** is a security solution that **monitors, filters, and enforces policy** on web traffic to protect users from internet-based threats. Positioned between users and the internet, SWGs provide **real-time protection** against malware, phishing, and data loss.

## 🎯 Purpose of SWGs

- 🔐 Prevent access to malicious or inappropriate websites
- ⚙️ Enforce acceptable use policies (AUP)
- 🛡️ Detect and block malware, phishing, and botnets
- 📤 Control and monitor outbound data (DLP)

## 🧱 Core Capabilities

| Feature                   | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **URL Filtering**          | Block or allow web access based on category or domain. |
| **Malware Scanning**       | Inspect traffic and file downloads for known and unknown threats. |
| **SSL Inspection**         | Decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic for hidden threats. |
| **Content Filtering**      | Block access to harmful or non-compliant content (e.g., adult, gambling). |
| **Data Loss Prevention**   | Monitor for unauthorized transmission of sensitive data. |
| **Access Control**         | Apply user/group-based policies using identity integration (e.g., LDAP, AD). |

## 🛠 SWG Deployment Models

| Model        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **On-Premises** | Deployed as physical or virtual appliances in a data center. |
| **Cloud-Based** | Delivered as SaaS; scalable and easier to manage for remote workforces. |
| **Hybrid**       | Combines on-prem and cloud controls for flexibility. |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A user's HTTP(S) request is routed through the SWG.
2. The SWG applies security policies:
   - Checks URL/category against block/allow list
   - Scans traffic and attachments for malware
   - Decrypts HTTPS if enabled
   - Applies DLP and content controls
3. The request is allowed, blocked, or redirected accordingly.
