**Bug bounty** and **penetration testing (pentesting)** are both proactive security practices that aim to uncover vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. While similar in goal, they differ in methodology, scope, and execution.

| Aspect              | Penetration Testing                         | Bug Bounty Programs                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Simulate a targeted cyberattack             | Crowdsourced vulnerability discovery     |
| **Participants**     | Internal security team or hired consultants | Global ethical hacker community          |
| **Scope**            | Defined and limited by contract             | Broad, defined by public or private program policy |
| **Timing**           | Point-in-time (quarterly, annually)         | Continuous, 24/7                         |
| **Cost Structure**   | Fixed cost or time-based                    | Pay-per-vulnerability                    |
| **Control Level**    | High (formal testing process)               | Variable (depends on program structure)  |

## 🔍 Penetration Testing Overview

### 🔐 Purpose

- Identify vulnerabilities through simulated real-world attacks
- Validate effectiveness of security controls

### 🧱 Phases (NIST SP 800-115)

1. **Planning** – Define scope, objectives, rules of engagement
2. **Discovery** – Gather intelligence, scan systems
3. **Attack/Exploitation** – Attempt to gain access or escalate privileges
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Document impact and pivot options
5. **Reporting** – Deliver technical and executive reports

### ✅ Pros
- Deep testing by experts
- Focused and controlled
- Ideal for compliance (e.g., PCI DSS)

### ⚠️ Cons
- Time-limited
- Expensive
- May miss low-hanging bugs

## 🐛 Bug Bounty Programs Overview

### 🌐 How It Works
Organizations publicly or privately invite ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards (cash, swag, recognition).

### 🏢 Popular Platforms
- **HackerOne**
- **Bugcrowd**
- **Synack**
- **Intigriti**
- **YesWeHack**

### 🎁 Reward Examples
- XSS = $100–$1,000
- RCE = $5,000–$50,000+
- Vulnerability severity usually tied to **CVSS score**

### ✅ Pros
- Diverse skill sets
- Continuous coverage
- Pay-for-results model

### ⚠️ Cons
- Requires dedicated triage and response team
- Possible flood of duplicate or low-quality reports
- Must carefully manage scope and legal protections
