**User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** is a cybersecurity technique that uses **machine learning** and **statistical models** to detect **anomalous behavior** of users, devices, or applications within an organization. It focuses on **patterns of activity** rather than static rules or known signatures.

UEBA is often integrated into SIEM and XDR platforms to enhance **insider threat detection**, **account compromise monitoring**, and **post-exploitation response**.

## üéØ Purpose of UEBA

- Detect **insider threats**, compromised accounts, and lateral movement
- Monitor behavior of **users**, **devices**, **applications**, and **service accounts**
- Identify **deviations from baselines** to flag suspicious activity
- Complement traditional rule-based alerting and SIEM tools

## üß† What UEBA Analyzes

| Entity Type        | Behavioral Baselines Built From                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Users**           | Logon times, access patterns, geolocation, device usage   |
| **Service Accounts**| Scheduled tasks, scripts, accessed systems and APIs       |
| **Endpoints**       | Network usage, process execution, software interaction    |
| **Applications**    | API calls, user roles, internal usage frequency           |
| **Network Flows**   | Normal communication paths, protocols, and data volumes   |

## üîç Detection Examples

| Anomaly Detected                                 | Possible Threat                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| User logs in from two countries 5 minutes apart  | **Impossible travel** ‚Üí Credential compromise            |
| Privileged account accesses HR data at 2 AM      | **Insider threat** or malware automation                 |
| Service account accesses new device for first time | **Lateral movement** or credential misuse               |
| Drastic spike in data exfiltration via web       | **Exfiltration activity** (e.g., cloud dump, FTP)        |
| Admin downloads tools never used before          | **Reconnaissance or staging for attack**                 |

## üõ°Ô∏è Benefits of UEBA

- Detects **unknown or zero-day threats**
- Uncovers **slow-moving APTs** and **insider threats**
- Reduces **false positives** through context-aware analysis
- Enables **risk-based alerting** (alerts scored based on severity & deviation)
- Improves **incident prioritization** for SOC analysts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Requires **clean baseline data** for effective training
- Can generate **false negatives** if attacker mimics normal behavior
- May be **resource-intensive** (compute + licensing)
- Works best when **integrated with SIEM or SOAR** tools

## üß¨ UEBA vs Traditional SIEM

| Feature              | Traditional SIEM               | UEBA                                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Detection Method     | Rule/signature-based           | Anomaly + behavior-based                     |
| Requires Known Threat?| Yes                            | No                                           |
| Adaptability         | Static rules                   | Learns over time                             |
| Strengths            | Known IOCs, compliance logs     | Unknown threats, user anomalies              |
| Weaknesses           | High false positives, signature gaps | Requires tuning, may miss slow anomalies |
