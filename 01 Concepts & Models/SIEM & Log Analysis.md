A **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system collects, aggregates, and analyzes logs and events from across an organization‚Äôs infrastructure to detect **security threats, policy violations, and anomalies** in real-time or through forensic analysis.

---

## üéØ Purpose of SIEM

- **Centralized log collection and correlation**
- **Real-time alerting** for security events
- Support for **incident response** and forensic investigations
- Enable **compliance reporting** (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Facilitate **threat detection** and **response automation**

> SIEM turns raw logs into actionable security intelligence.

## üß± Core SIEM Functions

| Function          | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Log Aggregation** | Ingests logs from firewalls, endpoints, servers, cloud  |
| **Normalization**  | Parses varied log formats into a unified structure       |
| **Correlation**    | Links related events across sources and time             |
| **Alerting**       | Triggers rules when patterns or thresholds are met       |
| **Dashboards**     | Visualizes key indicators (KPIs, incidents, trends)      |
| **Retention & Search** | Enables long-term storage and analysis             |

## üîç Common Data Sources

| Source                | Example Logs                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Firewall**           | Connection attempts, block rules    |
| **Endpoint Security**  | Malware detection, process execution|
| **Windows Event Logs** | Logon events, privilege escalation  |
| **Linux Syslogs**      | Auth logs, sudo usage, cron jobs    |
| **Cloud Services**     | API calls, IAM activity, config changes |
| **IDS/IPS**            | Intrusion alerts and signature matches |
| **Authentication Systems** | LDAP, RADIUS, Azure AD         |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

- Detect brute force or credential stuffing attempts
- Monitor lateral movement (e.g., SMB, RDP, WMI)
- Identify data exfiltration (unusual outbound traffic)
- Correlate multi-stage attacks (recon ‚Üí access ‚Üí C2)
- Track use of privilege escalation tools (e.g., Mimikatz)

## üìë Sample Log Events

### üîê Windows Event Log (Login)
```text
Event ID: 4624 (Successful Logon)
Account Name: jdoe
Logon Type: 10 (RemoteInteractive)
Source IP: 203.0.113.55
```

### üß¨ Syslog (Linux Auth)
```
sshd[1147]: Accepted password for root from 192.168.0.14 port 59210
```

### üõë Firewall
```
Blocked TCP from 5.188.86.153 to 10.1.1.10 on port 3389 (RDP)
```

## üß† Detection Rules and Logic

|Rule Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Signature-Based**|Match known threat patterns|
|**Behavioral/Heuristic**|Detect anomalies or rare behaviors|
|**Threshold-Based**|Alert on event count over time|
|**Correlation Rules**|Chain multiple low-severity events|

---

## üß™ Analysis Techniques

- **Search by IP, username, hostname**
- **Time-based correlation** (pivot around T0)
- **Frequency analysis** (spikes, rare events)
- **Outlier detection** (e.g., login from new geo-location)
- **Regex filtering** for custom extraction

## ‚öôÔ∏è SIEM Use in Incident Response

1. **Detection** ‚Äì Alerts trigger via rules or AI
2. **Investigation** ‚Äì Analysts review logs and timeline
3. **Containment** ‚Äì Identify scope and isolate affected assets
4. **Eradication** ‚Äì Root cause removed (e.g., malware, access)
5. **Recovery** ‚Äì Systems restored and monitored
6. **Lessons Learned** ‚Äì Reporting and rule updates

---

## üìò Real-World Example: Brute Force Detection

- 50 failed logins from single IP in 2 minutes
- Event ID 4625 (Logon Failure) flood
- Correlation triggers alert in SIEM
- Follow-up: IP blocked, account locked, investigation initiated
