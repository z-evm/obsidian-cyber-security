> A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group gains control of more than half (51%) of the computing power, stake, or mining hash rate in a blockchain network, allowing them to disrupt its consensus process.

## üìå What Is a 51% Attack?

- Happens when an attacker controls **>50%** of:
  - **Hashing power** (Proof of Work)
  - **Staked value** (Proof of Stake)
- Enables them to:
  - **Double spend** coins
  - **Censor transactions**
  - **Prevent new block confirmations**
  - **Fork the blockchain temporarily**

> Note: It does **not** allow stealing others‚Äô coins or forging invalid transactions.

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Example (PoW):
1. Attacker secretly mines a longer chain in parallel.
2. Meanwhile, spends coins on the public chain (e.g., at an exchange).
3. Once confirmed, attacker releases the longer fork.
4. Network accepts the longer chain ‚Üí transaction is reversed.
5. Attacker retains coins and goods ‚Äî **double spend success**.

## üîß Attack Capabilities

| Capability              | Description                                                           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Double Spending**       | Spend same coins twice by invalidating the original transaction        |
| **Transaction Censorship**| Refuse to include or confirm specific transactions                     |
| **Block Rewrites**        | Reorganize blockchain by replacing previous blocks                     |
| **Disrupt Mining/Validation** | Prevent others from mining/validating new blocks                 |

---

## üîê Limitations of a 51% Attack

- **Cannot** steal from wallets without private keys
- **Cannot** create coins out of thin air
- **Cannot** reverse confirmed transactions beyond a certain depth (finality limits)
- Often **short-term** due to high cost and rapid detection

## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk Factors

| Risk Factor              | Impact                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low Network Hashrate** | Easier for attacker to gain 51% control                              |
| **Centralized Mining Pools** | Increases risk if a few pools dominate                          |
| **Low Market Cap Coins** | Cheaper to attack than well-established blockchains                  |
| **Lack of Finality Mechanisms** | Increases fork and reorganization risk                     |

## üîê Mitigation Strategies

| Approach                 | Description                                                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Increased Hashrate**   | Makes attack cost-prohibitive                                        |
| **Chain Finality**       | Add checkpoints or finalization protocols (e.g., Ethereum's Casper)  |
| **Staking Penalties**    | Slash malicious validators in PoS networks                           |
| **Network Monitoring**   | Detect chain reorganizations quickly                                 |
| **Mining Decentralization** | Reduce risk of mining pool dominance                             |
