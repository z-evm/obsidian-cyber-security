**Security Operations Center (SOC)** metrics and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** provide measurable insight into how well the SOC detects, responds to, and manages security events.

They help security leaders assess performance, justify investments, and drive continuous improvement.

## 🎯 Purpose of SOC Metrics

- 📈 Track incident response efficiency
- 🧠 Identify gaps in detection and coverage
- 🔁 Enable continuous improvement
- ⚖️ Align security performance with business risk tolerance

## 📦 Core SOC Metrics and KPIs

| Metric / KPI                | Description                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)** | Avg. time to detect an incident after it occurs            |
| **MTTR (Mean Time to Respond/Remediate)** | Avg. time to contain or resolve a threat          |
| **Number of Incidents**     | Total security incidents logged in a defined period         |
| **False Positive Rate**     | % of alerts investigated that were not true threats         |
| **True Positive Rate (Detection Rate)** | % of real threats correctly identified             |
| **Incident Severity Distribution** | % of incidents by criticality (low, medium, high)      |
| **Incident Escalation Rate** | % of incidents escalated from Tier 1 to Tier 2/3 analysts  |
| **SOC Analyst Utilization** | Workload balance, alert fatigue, productivity tracking      |
| **Alert Volume**            | Total number of alerts generated by security tools          |
| **Dwell Time**              | Time a threat remains undetected in the environment         |
| **Case Closure Rate**       | % of security cases that are resolved within SLA            |
| **Repeat Incidents**        | Number of recurring incidents from the same root cause      |
| **Coverage Gaps**           | % of systems/networks unmonitored or missing logs           |

## 🧭 Strategic Metrics

| Metric                  | Relevance                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Posture Score** | Composite score based on detection, response, hygiene |
| **Incident Cost**        | Financial impact of incidents (recovery + loss)   |
| **Compliance Score**     | % alignment with frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)|
| **Threat Intelligence Usage** | # of incidents enriched by external threat intel   |

## 📌 Dashboard Best Practices

- 🎯 Use real-time visualizations (e.g., Kibana, Power BI, Grafana)
- 📊 Segment metrics by source, time, and severity
- 🔄 Update KPIs monthly or quarterly
- 🧾 Correlate metrics to business goals (e.g., risk reduction, SLA compliance)

---

## ✅ Improving SOC KPIs

- Automate alert triage to reduce MTTD
- Deploy EDR/SIEM integrations to improve detection coverage
- Use SOAR platforms to accelerate MTTR
- Conduct regular analyst training and tabletop exercises
- Optimize alert rules to reduce false positives

## 🛠 Tools for Tracking SOC Metrics

| Tool                    | Use Case                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar)** | Log correlation and alert reporting       |
| **SOAR (Cortex XSOAR, Swimlane)**   | Incident workflow metrics and SLA tracking |
| **Case Management (Jira, ServiceNow)** | Incident ticketing and closure analysis    |
| **Dashboards (Power BI, Kibana)**   | Visualize trends and performance           |
