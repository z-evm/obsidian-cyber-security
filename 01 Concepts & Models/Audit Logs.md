**Audit Logs** (also known as **audit trails**) are **chronological records of events and activities** performed by users, systems, or applications. They are essential for **accountability**, **forensics**, **compliance**, and **security monitoring**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Audit Logs answer the question:**  
> _"Who did what, when, where, and how?"_

Goals:
- Track user and system actions
- Enable **non-repudiation** and accountability
- Support **incident response** and **forensic investigations**
- Provide evidence for **compliance and audits**

## üß± Key Audit Log Elements

| Field                  | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Timestamp**           | Date and time of the event                 |
| **User/Actor**          | Who performed the action                   |
| **Action/Event Type**   | What occurred (login, file access, config change) |
| **Target Object**       | The resource affected (file, system, database) |
| **Source IP/Host**      | Where the action originated from           |
| **Result/Status**       | Success, failure, or error codes           |

## üì¶ Types of Logs

| Log Type              | Description                               | Example Entries                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication Logs**| Track login attempts, successes, failures| Windows Event ID 4625 (failed login)          |
| **System Logs**        | OS and kernel-level messages              | Syslog, Event Viewer                          |
| **Application Logs**   | Logs from custom or third-party software  | Web server access logs                        |
| **Security Logs**      | Events related to threats or violations   | Firewall rules triggered, AV detections       |
| **Network Logs**       | Traffic flow and communication patterns   | NetFlow, DNS queries, VPN usage               |
| **Audit Logs**         | Tracks changes to system configurations   | File changes, GPO edits, sudo actions         |

## üîç What Makes Good Audit Data?

- **Accuracy**: Time-synced logs (e.g., via NTP)
- **Completeness**: Covers all relevant systems and applications
- **Integrity**: Logs are protected from tampering
- **Retention**: Stored per compliance policies (e.g., 1 year+)
- **Correlation-ready**: Easily parsed and normalized for SIEM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Incomplete or missing logs
- Poor time synchronization
- No log review process
- Insufficient retention policies
- Lack of access controls on logs

## üîç Audit Logging vs Event Logging

| Feature             | Audit Logging                              | General Event Logging                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**           | User/system actions for security and compliance | System performance, error reporting         |
| **Retention**       | Longer (compliance-driven)                  | Shorter (operational focus)                   |
| **Access Controls** | Restricted and tamper-proof                 | Often system-readable                         |

---

## üõ° Use Cases

- **Incident Response**: Trace actions during a breach
- **Compliance Audits**: Demonstrate enforcement of access policies
- **Forensics**: Reconstruct attacker timeline
- **Change Management**: Validate who made system/config changes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual behavior (e.g., login from unknown location)
