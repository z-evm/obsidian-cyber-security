**Parallel processing** is a computing model in which **multiple processors or cores execute tasks simultaneously**, allowing systems to solve problems faster by dividing workloads. It’s foundational to **high-performance computing (HPC)**, modern **multicore CPUs**, and **distributed systems** like clusters and cloud platforms.

## 🧱 Key Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Parallelism**  | Different threads/tasks perform different operations in parallel      |
| **Data Parallelism**  | Same operation applied to chunks of data simultaneously               |
| **Concurrency**       | Multiple tasks are in progress (not necessarily executing at the same instant) |
| **Throughput**        | Total amount of work done per unit time                               |
| **Latency**           | Time taken to complete a single task                                  |

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Race Conditions** – Concurrent access to shared resources
- 🔐 **Thread Isolation** – Ensure memory separation across threads
- 🧱 **Workload Segmentation** – Avoid leakage between tenant workloads
- 📋 **Job Scheduling Logs** – Audit for workload integrity and abuse
- 🚫 **DoS Risk** – Parallel job overload may consume shared system resources
