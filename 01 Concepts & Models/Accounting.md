**Accounting** is the third pillar of the **AAA Framework** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting). It refers to the **logging**, **tracking**, and **auditing** of user activities to ensure security, compliance, and forensic readiness.

---

## üéØ Purpose of Accounting

> **Accounting answers the question:**  
> _"What did you do, when, and where?"_

It ensures that all access and usage events are **recorded**, **retained**, and **reviewable** for security monitoring, auditing, and non-repudiation.

| **Access to resources**          | Which files, systems, or data were accessed               |
| **Configuration changes**        | Who modified settings or policies                         |
| **Command execution**            | Commands run on servers, especially privileged actions     |
| **Network activity**             | IP addresses, ports, protocols used                       |

## üìÑ Common Accounting Tools & Logs

| Tool / Log Type         | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar)** | Centralized log aggregation and alerting           |
| **Syslog**               | Standard logging protocol for UNIX/Linux systems     |
| **Windows Event Logs**   | Logs for login attempts, app usage, system changes   |
| **Firewall Logs**        | Records of allowed/blocked traffic                  |
| **VPN Logs**             | Session duration, IP address, user activity          |
| **Cloud Audit Logs**     | GCP, AWS, Azure ‚Äî user and API activity              |

## üîÑ Accounting in the AAA Framework

| Step          | Role of Accounting                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Record login attempts and method used                   |
| **Authorization**  | Track what permissions or roles were exercised          |
| **Accounting**     | Log all resulting actions, changes, or access            |

## üìã Use Cases

| Scenario                         | Accounting Function                               |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Incident response                | Logs show who accessed breached data              |
| Insider threat investigation     | Tracks file downloads by internal users           |
| Compliance audit (e.g., PCI-DSS) | Provides access history and usage documentation   |
| Forensic analysis                | Event reconstruction from logs                    |

## üõ° Benefits of Strong Accounting

- **Non-repudiation**
- **Auditing and compliance**
- **Threat detection and response**
- **Accountability and transparency**
- **Evidence collection (forensics)**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses and Challenges

- **Log overload** without proper filtering or alerting
- **Insufficient retention** for compliance
- **Log tampering** if not securely stored
- **Lack of correlation** between different systems

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Centralize logs with a **SIEM**
- Implement **time synchronization** (NTP) for accurate logging
- Secure logs against unauthorized access or modification
- Regularly **review and audit** logs
- Retain logs in line with legal/compliance requirements
