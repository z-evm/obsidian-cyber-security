The **OWASP Top 10 (2024 Edition)** is a standard awareness document that outlines the ten most critical web application security risks. It serves as a foundational reference for developers, security professionals, and organizations to assess, mitigate, and prioritize web security threats.

Published by the **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)**, the Top 10 is based on extensive data from vulnerabilities, security tools, and industry trends.

## 📊 OWASP Top 10 - 2024 List

| Rank | Risk | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| A01  | **Broken Access Control** | Failures to restrict access to resources, enabling privilege escalation, horizontal/vertical access, or unauthorized data exposure. |
| A02  | **Cryptographic Failures** | Weak or absent protection of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens, PII) due to poor cryptographic practices. |
| A03  | **Injection** | Attacker sends untrusted data to an interpreter (SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP) leading to arbitrary commands or queries. |
| A04  | **Insecure Design** | Flawed architecture or insecure design patterns that cannot be mitigated by technical patches alone. |
| A05  | **Security Misconfiguration** | Default settings, unnecessary services, verbose error messages, or overly permissive policies. |
| A06  | **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** | Use of components with known vulnerabilities (libraries, frameworks, platforms). |
| A07  | **Identification and Authentication Failures** | Weak authentication, session management flaws, brute-force susceptibility. |
| A08  | **Software and Data Integrity Failures** | Insecure software supply chains, CI/CD pipelines, or unsigned/unauthenticated code updates. |
| A09  | **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** | Insufficient logging, alerting, or visibility into attack attempts and system events. |
| A10  | **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | An attacker induces the server to fetch a remote resource, leading to internal service discovery or data exposure. |

## 🔍 Risk Summary

### 🔐 A01 – Broken Access Control
- **Examples**: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), missing authorization checks
- **Impact**: Data leakage, privilege escalation

### 🔐 A02 – Cryptographic Failures
- **Examples**: Unencrypted transmission (e.g., HTTP), weak ciphers, hardcoded keys
- **Impact**: Credential theft, data breach, man-in-the-middle attacks

### 💉 A03 – Injection
- **Examples**: SQLi, XSS, OS Command Injection
- **Impact**: Data exfiltration, system compromise, account takeover

### 🧱 A04 – Insecure Design
- **Examples**: Lack of threat modeling, failing to enforce business constraints
- **Impact**: Vulnerabilities built into the system from inception

### ⚙️ A05 – Security Misconfiguration
- **Examples**: Open S3 buckets, unnecessary HTTP methods, default credentials
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, unauthorized access

### 🧬 A06 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **Examples**: Unpatched libraries, unsupported software
- **Impact**: Exploitable known vulnerabilities

### 🧑‍💼 A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures
- **Examples**: Missing MFA, session ID exposed in URL, password stuffing
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access, session hijacking

### 🧾 A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Examples**: Unsigned updates, malicious code injection in CI/CD pipeline
- **Impact**: Supply chain compromise, malware propagation

### 📉 A09 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- **Examples**: No alerting on failed logins, missing audit trails
- **Impact**: Delayed incident response, undetected intrusions

### 🌐 A10 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Examples**: Attacker tricks server into accessing internal systems or cloud metadata
- **Impact**: Internal service scanning, sensitive data leakage

## ✅ Recommendations

- Perform **threat modeling** and **secure design reviews**
- Adopt **secure coding practices** and input validation
- Use automated tools (e.g., **SAST**, **DAST**, **SBOM scanners**)
- Keep components **updated and patched**
- Enforce **strong authentication and session management**
- Monitor systems with **SIEM**, **EDR**, and **audit logging**
- Educate developers with **OWASP guidelines**, cheat sheets, and secure SDLC integration
