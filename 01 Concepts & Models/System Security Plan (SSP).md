A **System Security Plan (SSP)** is a formal document that outlines the **security requirements**, **controls**, and **implementation details** for an information system. It is a key deliverable in the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** and mandatory for FISMA compliance.

---

## üéØ Purpose of an SSP

- üìã Document how a system meets applicable security requirements
- üîç Provide a comprehensive view of system components and controls
- üß© Serve as the foundation for audits, assessments, and ATO decisions
- ‚úÖ Support continuous monitoring and authorization processes

---

## üì¶ Required by

- **FISMA**
- **FedRAMP**
- **NIST SP 800-37 / RMF**
- **NIST SP 800-53** control implementation
- Other regulatory frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, DoD RMF)

| Section                      | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Identification**     | Name, owner, categorization (FIPS 199), environment           |
| **System Description**        | Overview of system purpose, architecture, components         |
| **Authorization Boundary**    | Defines what‚Äôs in and out of scope                           |
| **System Environment**        | OS, network, cloud, on-prem, connections                     |
| **Security Control Implementation** | How each NIST SP 800-53 control is applied          |
| **Roles and Responsibilities**| Key personnel: ISSO, AO, SCA, Owner                         |
| **Interconnections**          | Interfaces with other systems (internal/external)            |
| **Data Sensitivity**          | Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability levels              |
| **Security Policies and Procedures** | Referenced documentation                              |
| **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)** | Tracks unresolved or deferred controls             |

## üõ† Control Implementation Summary

Each **NIST SP 800-53 control** included in the SSP should detail:

- ‚úçÔ∏è **Implementation status**: Fully implemented, partially, or planned
- üß∞ **Method of implementation**: How it's enforced (technical, admin, physical)
- üìé **Supporting evidence**: Logs, screenshots, policies, configs
- üìÜ **Responsible party**: Role or team responsible for the control

## üîÅ SSP Lifecycle

| Phase           | Activity                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Development**  | Initial control selection and documentation |
| **Review**       | Internal review by stakeholders            |
| **Assessment**   | Evaluation by Security Control Assessor (SCA)|
| **Authorization**| Used in decision to issue ATO               |
| **Update**       | Revised after major changes or annually     |

## üìä SSP vs Other RMF Artifacts

| Document     | Purpose                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **SSP**       | Describes how security is implemented   |
| **SAR**       | Assesses effectiveness of controls      |
| **POA&M**     | Tracks gaps, remediation plans          |
| **ATO Letter**| Authorizing Official's decision summary |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Match each SSP control to evidence and responsibilities
- Use templates or automation tools (e.g., eMASS, OpenRMF)
- Update after system changes or audit findings
- Ensure traceability between SSP and test results (SAR)
- Apply consistent formatting and version control

## üß∞ Tools and Templates

| Tool              | Function                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **OpenRMF**       | Open-source RMF and SSP collaboration     |
| **eMASS** (DoD)   | Automated RMF package management          |
| **Xacta**         | Commercial GRC platform with SSP builder  |
| **Markdown / Word Templates** | Manual SSP creation and tracking    |
