> Writing secure smart contracts is critical to protect on-chain assets, maintain trust, and prevent catastrophic loss due to **immutable vulnerabilities**.

## 📌 Why Security Matters in Smart Contracts

- Once deployed, smart contracts are **immutable** — bugs become **permanent**.
- Many high-profile hacks (e.g., The DAO, Poly Network, Ronin Bridge) exploited contract flaws.
- Security should be integrated **from design to deployment**.

## ✅ Best Practices Overview

### 🔧 1. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege
- Restrict who can call sensitive functions (e.g., admin-only).
- Use `onlyOwner`, `accessControl`, or multisig mechanisms.

### 📦 2. Use Established Libraries
- Rely on **well-audited** libraries like **OpenZeppelin**.
- Avoid reinventing cryptographic primitives or token standards.

### 🔐 3. Use Safe Math and Types
- Prevent overflow/underflow with:
  - `SafeMath` (pre-Solidity 0.8)
  - Built-in checks (Solidity ≥0.8 handles this by default)

### 🚫 4. Prevent Reentrancy Attacks
- Use **checks-effects-interactions** pattern.
- Leverage `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin.
```solidity
modifier nonReentrant { ... }
```

### 🔁 5. Validate External Calls

- Always check the **return value** of `call`, `delegatecall`, or `send`.
- Avoid using `tx.origin` for authorization.

### ⛽ 6. Consider Gas Limit & DoS Risks

- Avoid unbounded loops, large arrays, or gas-heavy operations.
- Be cautious with `fallback()` and `receive()` functions.

### 📜 7. Lock Contract Logic (Modifiers)

- Use **modifiers** to restrict access:
```
modifier onlyOwner { ... }
```
- Ensure critical functions can't be called multiple times (e.g., initialization functions).

### 🧪 8. Write Extensive Tests

- Test with:
    - Edge cases
    - Multiple users
    - Attack simulations
- Use test suites like **Hardhat**, **Truffle**, and **Foundry**.

### 🧹 9. Fail Gracefully

- Use `require`, `assert`, and `revert` with informative error messages.
- Prevent unexpected execution by setting proper fallbacks.

### 🔍 10. Use Formal Verification Where Applicable

- Tools like **Certora**, **Scribble**, and **MythX** support logic verification.
- Useful for DeFi, asset management, and DAO contracts.

## 📦 Secure Upgrade Patterns

- Use **proxy contracts** with proper upgrade logic (e.g., UUPS, Transparent Proxy).
- Maintain strict control over upgrade functions (admin roles or multisig).
- Document all upgrade paths and migration steps.

---

## 📜 Deployment Checklist

-  Code reviewed by multiple developers
-  Automated and manual tests passed
-  Contracts audited (internal or external)
-  Source code published & verified
-  Admin keys secured (multisig or HSM)
-  Upgrade logic (if any) documented
-  Monitors and alerts configured

## 🧠 Security+ Relevance

- Reflects **secure coding practices**, **vulnerability management**, and **application security** in blockchain systems.
- Tied to:
    - Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
    - Secure design and implementation
    - Incident prevention and mitigation
