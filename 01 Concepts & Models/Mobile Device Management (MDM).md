**Mobile Device Management (MDM)** is a technology and policy framework used by organizations to **secure, monitor, manage, and support mobile devices** used in the enterprise—including smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

MDM is essential for enforcing **security policies, data protection, and remote control** over both corporate-owned and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) assets.

## 🎯 Purpose of MDM

- 🔐 Enforce **security controls** on mobile endpoints
- 📵 Manage **device access to corporate resources**
- 🧼 Remotely **wipe or lock devices** if lost or stolen
- 🧾 Ensure **compliance** with corporate and regulatory policies
- 💼 Support **BYOD policies** with sandboxed enterprise apps

## ⚠️ Risks Without MDM

| Risk                    | Impact                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 📱 Lost/stolen device   | Unencrypted data breach                                 |
| 📥 Unvetted apps         | Malware infection, data exfiltration                    |
| 🔓 Weak authentication   | Unauthorized access to enterprise services              |
| 🛑 No remote control      | Inability to enforce security or lock device remotely   |
| 🔄 Shadow IT             | Users bypass corporate controls with unmanaged tools    |

## 🧠 BYOD Considerations

- 🧩 Use **MAM** for data control without full device access
- 🛡 Provide **separation of personal and corporate data**
- 📜 Have a **clear acceptable use policy (AUP)**
- ⚖️ Ensure **legal and privacy compliance** in employee jurisdictions
