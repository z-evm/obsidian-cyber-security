> Consensus mechanisms are protocols used in distributed systems (especially blockchains) to achieve agreement on a single version of data among nodes, ensuring consistency, trust, and security.

---

## üìå Purpose of Consensus

- Achieve **agreement** in a decentralized network without a central authority.
- Ensure **data integrity** and **immutability**.
- Prevent **double spending**, **forks**, and **malicious manipulation**.
- Facilitate the addition of new data (e.g., blocks) in a secure, verifiable way.

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distributed Ledger** | All nodes maintain a synchronized copy of the database                    |
| **Fault Tolerance**    | Network must handle failures or malicious actors                          |
| **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** | Network must reach consensus even with dishonest nodes             |
| **Finality**           | Once consensus is achieved, data is considered committed and irreversible |

## üîÑ Common Consensus Mechanisms

### 1. üîß Proof of Work (PoW)
- Requires miners to solve complex math problems.
- Energy-intensive but proven (e.g., Bitcoin).
- Ensures tamper resistance via computational difficulty.

> See: [[Proof of Work (PoW)]]

---

### 2. üßÆ Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency "staked".
- Energy-efficient alternative to PoW.
- Used by Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Solana.

> See: [[Proof of Stake (PoS)]]

---

### 3. üó≥ Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Token holders vote to elect a small number of delegates.
- High throughput and low latency.
- Used by EOS, Tron.

---

### 4. ‚öñ Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- Nodes exchange signed messages to reach consensus.
- Tolerates up to 1/3 malicious nodes.
- Fast finality but less scalable.

---

### 5. üîê Proof of Authority (PoA)
- Relies on trusted validators with known identities.
- Fast and efficient; suitable for private or consortium chains.

---

### 6. üîó Hybrid Approaches
- Combine PoW/PoS or integrate PBFT with other models.
- Example: Ethereum 1.0 PoW ‚Üí Ethereum 2.0 PoS.
