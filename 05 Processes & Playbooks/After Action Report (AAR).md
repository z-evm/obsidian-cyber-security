An **After Action Report (AAR)** is a formal document that captures observations, strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations following a significant incident, exercise, or crisis. It is used to evaluate response effectiveness and support continuous improvement.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Analyze what **happened**, **why it happened**, and **how to improve**.
- Identify **gaps in plans**, procedures, communications, and tools.
- Document **lessons learned** for future preparedness.
- Inform updates to the [[Crisis Management Plan (CMP)]], [[Incident Response Planning (IRP)]], or [[Business Continuity Planning (BCP)]].

## üìã AAR Key Elements

| Section                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event Overview**          | Type of event (real-world incident or exercise), date/time, scope, and objectives. |
| **Executive Summary**       | High-level review of outcomes, impacts, and findings.                       |
| **Timeline of Events**      | Chronological sequence of key actions and decisions.                        |
| **Participant Roles**       | Who was involved (e.g., IR team, executives, IT, legal, comms).             |
| **What Worked Well**        | Effective actions, procedures, or tools used.                               |
| **Areas for Improvement**   | Gaps, delays, miscommunications, control failures.                         |
| **Root Cause Analysis**     | Underlying technical or procedural issues that contributed to the event.    |
| **Recommendations**         | Specific actions to improve plans, tools, training, or coordination.        |
| **Corrective Action Plan**  | List of follow-up tasks, deadlines, and responsible parties.                |
| **Appendices**              | Logs, communications, diagrams, screenshots, evidence artifacts.           |

## üõ† AAR Process Flow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather logs, reports, communications, and debrief notes.

2. **Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Conduct structured debriefs with involved personnel.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Use methods like 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram.

4. **Draft the Report**
   - Summarize findings and draft actionable insights.

5. **Review and Approve**
   - Share with leadership and key stakeholders for validation.

6. **Implement Improvements**
   - Track corrective actions via POA&M or change management systems.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **neutral facilitators** for objectivity.
- Focus on **facts and improvement**, not blame.
- Keep a **lessons learned repository**.
- Include AARs in audit trails and compliance records.
- Schedule AARs within **48‚Äì72 hours** of the event when possible.

## üîÅ AAR vs. Postmortem

| AAR                             | Postmortem                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Structured, formal, often regulated | Often informal, internal tech-centric    |
| Includes executive and business input | Primarily technical/engineering focused |
| Covers people, process, and policy | Focuses on code, bugs, infrastructure    |
