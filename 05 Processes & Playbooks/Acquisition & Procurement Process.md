## üéØ Purpose

- Minimize security risks from external products or services
- Ensure vendor solutions meet organizational **policies**, **compliance** requirements, and **risk tolerance**
- Align procurement with **business continuity**, **data protection**, and **threat modeling**

| **Market Research**         | Evaluate vendors, products, certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2)         |
| **Risk Assessment**         | Analyze security impact, threat exposure, and vendor risk                   |
| **RFP/RFQ Development**     | Define technical, functional, and security specifications in formal documents |
| **Vendor Evaluation**       | Assess proposals, perform due diligence, verify compliance                  |
| **Security Review**         | Perform technical and policy-based vetting (e.g., penetration test reports) |
| **Contract & SLA Negotiation** | Include data protection, breach notification, liability clauses        |
| **Procurement & Deployment**| Acquire, implement, and monitor product in production                      |

## üîê Security Considerations

| Area                       | Concern                                       | Example                                            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Third-Party Risk**        | Vendor compromise could impact internal systems | SolarWinds supply chain attack                     |
| **Software Integrity**      | Risk of backdoors, malicious code             | Request code audits or signed binaries             |
| **Licensing & Compliance**  | Non-compliance risks legal and operational issues | GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS requirements                  |
| **Data Residency**          | Cloud services may store data internationally  | Cloud vendor must align with data sovereignty laws |
| **End-of-Life**             | Legacy systems introduce vulnerabilities       | Ensure vendor offers updates and patching support  |
