**Wireless penetration testing** is the process of simulating attacks on wireless networks, devices, and communication protocols to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insecure practices. It typically focuses on Wi-Fi (802.11), Bluetooth, and RFID/NFC environments.

## üéØ Objectives of Wireless Pentesting

- Identify and assess wireless networks (APs, SSIDs, hidden networks)
- Exploit weak encryption or authentication (e.g., WPA2 cracking)
- Bypass network isolation or guest segmentation
- Test rogue access point resilience
- Identify vulnerable wireless clients and IoT devices

## üß± Wireless Pentest Phases

### 1. üîç Reconnaissance

| Task                        | Tools                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Discover networks & SSIDs   | `airodump-ng`, `Kismet`, `bettercap` |
| Identify clients and BSSIDs | `airodump-ng`, `Wireshark` |
| Locate hidden SSIDs         | Probe request analysis      |
| Monitor channel activity    | Spectrum analysis tools     |

### 2. üîê Vulnerability Assessment

| Technique                     | Description                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Weak encryption detection     | WEP/WPA1/WPA2-Personal in use                |
| Open network identification   | No encryption or MAC filtering               |
| Misconfigured enterprise auth | Poor EAP methods (e.g., EAP-MD5)             |
| Rogue AP susceptibility       | No AP whitelist, no 802.1X cert pinning      |

---

### 3. üéØ Exploitation

| Attack Type            | Tools                    | Goal                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| WPA2 handshake capture | `airodump-ng`, `hcxdumptool` | Crack PSK offline        |
| Deauthentication attack| `aireplay-ng`, `mdk4`    | Force reconnection or rogue AP |
| Evil twin AP           | `hostapd`, `Wifiphisher` | Harvest credentials         |
| KRACK replay           | Custom tools/scripts      | Exploit WPA2 4-way handshake |
| WPS brute-force        | `reaver`, `bully`         | Retrieve PIN or PSK         |

### 4. üì° Client-Side Attacks

| Attack                | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Karma attack          | Responds to probe requests to spoof SSIDs   |
| Mis-association       | Trick client into joining rogue AP          |
| Captive portal phishing | Harvest credentials on fake login pages   |
| LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing | Capture hashes on open network (via `Responder`) |

---

### 5. üìú Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement

- ARP spoofing, packet sniffing, and MITM (e.g., `ettercap`)
- Credential harvesting from HTTP/S sessions
- Pivoting into internal network via compromised client
- Identify unencrypted services and misconfigured firewalls

## üõ† Essential Wireless Pentest Toolkit

| Tool            | Purpose                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Aircrack-ng`   | Handshake capture, injection, cracking     |
| `Bettercap`     | Wireless MITM, BLE & NFC attacks           |
| `Kismet`        | Passive recon, GPS tagging                 |
| `hcxdumptool`   | Fast WPA handshake capture & PMKID grab    |
| `Wifiphisher`   | Evil twin + social engineering              |
| `Wireshark`     | 802.11 frame analysis                      |
| `Flipper Zero`  | Multi-radio physical layer testing         |

## ‚úÖ Reporting & Remediation

- Summarize:
  - SSIDs, encryption type, vulnerable clients, rogue APs
  - Captured handshakes, WPS PINs, credential leaks
- Provide remediation:
  - Migrate to WPA3
  - Enforce EAP-TLS with certificate pinning
  - Disable WPS, isolate guest networks
  - Use network monitoring (e.g., WIDS)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Guidelines

- Always operate under a signed **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
- Obtain written permission to test wireless infrastructure
- Use controlled signal strength and avoid neighboring networks
- Follow **local RF regulations**
