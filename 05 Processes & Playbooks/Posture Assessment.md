**Posture Assessment** is the process of evaluating the **security health** and **configuration compliance** of a device or system before granting access to network resources. It‚Äôs a core component of **Zero Trust**, **Network Access Control (NAC)**, and **endpoint compliance enforcement**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Ensure that connecting devices meet **security and compliance standards**  
- Detect and block **vulnerable**, **unpatched**, or **misconfigured systems**  
- Prevent access from **non-compliant** or **unmanaged** endpoints  
- Automate **remediation** and **policy enforcement** prior to access

## üß± Key Elements of Posture

| Element                 | Description                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Operating System**     | Version, patch level, EOL status                   |
| **Antivirus/EDR Status** | Installed, running, updated                        |
| **Firewall Configuration** | Enabled and properly configured                |
| **Disk Encryption**      | Full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault) |
| **MFA Enrollment**       | User or device is MFA-enabled                     |
| **Device Health State**  | CPU, memory, storage thresholds                    |
| **Compliance Policies**  | Organization-specific security benchmarks          |

## üõ† Technologies Used

| Tool / Platform         | Functionality                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **NAC (e.g., Cisco ISE, FortiNAC)** | Blocks/quarantines non-compliant devices |
| **MDM (e.g., Intune, Jamf)** | Device enrollment, posture compliance     |
| **EDR/XDR**              | Agent-based monitoring and remediation       |
| **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** | Conditional access based on posture |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** | Evaluates device risk scores        |

---

## üìã Example Posture Checks

- Is the OS up to date with the latest patches?
- Is antivirus software installed and running?
- Is full-disk encryption enabled?
- Has the device been jailbroken or rooted?
- Is the firewall enabled?
- Has the user passed an MFA challenge?

## üß™ Enforcement Scenarios

| Scenario                    | Action Taken                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Compliant Device**         | Granted access to protected network/resources    |
| **Non-Compliant Device**     | Redirected to remediation portal or quarantined |
| **Unknown Device**           | Denied access or restricted to guest VLAN        |
| **Compromised Device**       | Access blocked and alert sent to SOC             |

---

## üîê Integration with Security Controls

- **SIEM**: Log and correlate posture failures  
- **EDR/XDR**: Detect and remediate vulnerabilities  
- **Firewall/ACLs**: Enforce conditional access rules  
- **DLP**: Prevent data access from unmanaged endpoints  
- **MFA/IAM**: Link identity posture to authentication decisions

## ‚öñÔ∏è Compliance Relevance

| Standard           | Requirement                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **HIPAA**          | Ensure devices accessing PHI are secured  |
| **PCI-DSS**        | Require antivirus and patching on endpoints |
| **ISO 27001**      | Enforce asset and configuration controls   |
| **NIST 800-171**   | Define controls for access and system maintenance |

---

## üõ° Best Practices

- Use **real-time posture evaluation**, not just periodic scans  
- Enforce **conditional access** based on device risk level  
- Automate remediation (patch, isolate, update) where possible  
- Create **user awareness** of posture compliance policies  
- Log and audit all posture assessments and outcomes
