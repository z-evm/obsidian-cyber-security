A **Phishing Response Workflow** outlines the steps security teams follow to **identify, contain, investigate, and remediate** phishing attacks. A well-defined response process reduces risk, limits impact, and strengthens future resilience.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Detect and **respond to phishing attempts** quickly
- Minimize user impact and data exposure
- Contain malicious payloads and accounts
- Enable forensics, reporting, and user education

## üß≠ Phishing Response Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Detection**

| Method                      | Description                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **User reports**            | Via phishing report button or helpdesk        |
| **Email filtering/SEG**     | Sandboxing or URL detection                   |
| **EDR alerts**              | Detect post-click behavior                    |
| **SIEM logs**               | Analyze abnormal login attempts               |

---

### 2. **Triage and Verification**

- Analyze email headers, attachments, and links
- Check for:
  - Spoofed sender
  - Obfuscated URLs
  - Suspicious language or file types
- Confirm if it‚Äôs a **true phishing attempt**, spam, or false positive

---

### 3. **Containment**

| Action                            | Purpose                                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Quarantine message**           | Remove from inboxes via mail flow rules     |
| **Block sender/domain/IP**       | On email gateway/firewall                   |
| **Disable malicious links**      | URL rewriting or link blocking              |
| **Notify users**                 | Warn those who received but didn‚Äôt report   |
| **Disable compromised accounts** | Stop lateral movement or internal phishing  |

---

### 4. **Investigation**

- Collect:
  - Headers, payloads, URLs, and attachments
  - User reports and interaction logs
- Analyze:
  - Attachment behavior (sandbox or static analysis)
  - Destination domains (malware, credential harvesting)
  - Logs (email, endpoint, network)

---

### 5. **Eradication and Remediation**

| Task                            | Description                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Remove email copies**         | From mailboxes, archives, quarantine        |
| **Reset passwords**             | For compromised accounts                    |
| **Reimage or clean endpoints**  | Remove malware or unauthorized changes      |
| **Re-enable accounts**          | After validation and recovery               |
| **Update detection rules**      | Adjust SEG/EDR signatures, SIEM rules       |

---

### 6. **Notification & Reporting**

- Notify internal teams (IT, legal, leadership)
- Report to external authorities if required:
  - CERT
  - Law enforcement
  - Privacy regulator (if PII/PHI affected)
- Use platforms like **MSRC**, **PhishTank**, or **Spamhaus**

---

### 7. **Post-Incident Review**

- What succeeded? What failed?
- Did the SEG, training, or MFA help mitigate?
- Document the incident in a report or ticket
- Update policies, detection rules, and user training

---

### 8. **User Awareness and Training**

- Send awareness bulletins
- Provide real examples in phishing training modules
- Consider simulated phishing campaigns (e.g., KnowBe4, Cofense)
