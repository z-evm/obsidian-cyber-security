The **remediation and patching process** involves identifying, prioritizing, fixing, and verifying vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and devices. It is a critical component of **vulnerability management** and **risk reduction**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔐 Minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities
- 📉 Reduce risk of exploitation by attackers
- ✅ Maintain compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI, HIPAA)
- 🔄 Ensure continuous security hygiene

---

## 🔄 Remediation Lifecycle

### 1. 🧪 **Identification**
- Vulnerabilities are discovered via:
  - Vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, Qualys)
  - Penetration testing
  - Threat intelligence feeds
  - Bug bounty disclosures

### 2. 📊 **Risk Assessment and Prioritization**
- Assess each finding based on:
  - CVSS score (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Asset value and exposure (public-facing? internal?)
  - Threat likelihood and exploitability
  - Business impact and regulatory scope

### 3. 🛠 **Remediation and Patching**
- Apply **vendor patches** (e.g., Windows Update, yum, apt)
- Perform **secure configuration changes**
- Use **workarounds or compensating controls** (e.g., WAF rules, ACLs)
- Upgrade or replace deprecated software/hardware

### 4. 🔁 **Verification and Validation**
- Re-scan systems to confirm remediation success
- Check version numbers and system logs
- Document status: ✅ resolved, 🟡 mitigated, ❌ not fixed, 🛑 accepted risk

### 5. 🧾 **Documentation and Reporting**
- Track remediation timelines, responsible teams, and outcomes
- Align with internal SLAs and compliance deadlines
- Feed results into SIEM, GRC, or vulnerability management dashboards

## 🧱 Patch Management Best Practices

| Practice                     | Description                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset Inventory**           | Know what software and systems are in your environment        |
| **Patch Baselines**           | Define standard patch levels per system type                  |
| **Scheduled Maintenance**     | Define patch windows to avoid business disruption             |
| **Testing Before Deployment** | Validate patches in staging before production rollout         |
| **Rollback Strategy**         | Ensure recovery is possible in case of patch failure          |
| **Automated Tools**           | Use tools like WSUS, SCCM, Ansible, PDQ Deploy, etc.          |
| **Patch Critical Systems First** | Prioritize external-facing and high-value assets            |

## ⚠️ Remediation Challenges

- Legacy systems with no vendor support
- Downtime requirements for patching critical apps
- Compatibility issues (e.g., OS patches breaking applications)
- Lack of visibility into asset inventory
- Patch fatigue and alert overload
