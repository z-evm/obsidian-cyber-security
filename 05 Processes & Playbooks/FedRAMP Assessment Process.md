The **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** standardizes the security assessment and authorization process for **cloud service providers (CSPs)** working with U.S. federal agencies. It ensures consistent and repeatable evaluation of cloud security.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure CSPs meet **Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)** requirements.
- Standardize cloud security assessments using **NIST SP 800-53** controls.
- Provide a reusable, government-wide **Authorization to Operate (ATO)** process.
- Promote trust, transparency, and security in federal cloud adoption.

## üß± FedRAMP Authorization Paths

| Path                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JAB Authorization**     | Sponsored by the Joint Authorization Board (DoD, DHS, GSA) ‚Äì high visibility. |
| **Agency Authorization**  | Sponsored by a single federal agency. More flexible and quicker for CSPs.    |
| **FedRAMP Tailored**      | For Low-Impact SaaS applications. Streamlined requirements.                 |

## üîÅ FedRAMP Assessment Lifecycle

### 1. **Initiation**
- Select authorization path (JAB vs. Agency).
- Engage a sponsoring agency (for Agency ATO).
- Choose a FedRAMP-accredited **Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)**.

### 2. **Pre-Authorization**
- Develop the **System Security Plan (SSP)** aligned to NIST SP 800-53 (Low/Moderate/High).
- Conduct internal security readiness review.
- Submit package to FedRAMP PMO for review (JAB route) or directly to agency.

### 3. **Security Assessment**
- 3PAO conducts an **independent assessment** of implemented controls.
- Produce the **Security Assessment Plan (SAP)** and **Security Assessment Report (SAR)**.
- Identify findings and draft a **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)**.

### 4. **Authorization**
- Agency or JAB reviews:
  - SSP  
  - SAR  
  - POA&M  
  - Continuous Monitoring Plan
- If acceptable, they issue an **Authorization to Operate (ATO)**.

### 5. **Continuous Monitoring**
- Monthly reporting of vulnerabilities and scan results.
- Annual assessments by 3PAO.
- Regular POA&M updates and incident reporting.

## üìã Required Documentation

| Document                     | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Security Plan (SSP)** | Defines the cloud system‚Äôs controls and architecture.                   |
| **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** | Details findings from 3PAO's technical evaluation.              |
| **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** | Tracks remediation of control deficiencies.             |
| **Security Assessment Plan (SAP)** | Outlines the scope and methodology of 3PAO testing.             |
| **Continuous Monitoring Plan** | Describes how ongoing risk and control health are tracked.            |

## üîê Baseline Control Levels

| Impact Level | Control Set (NIST SP 800-53) | Example Use Case                                |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | ~125 controls                | Public, non-sensitive SaaS (e.g., contact forms) |
| **Moderate** | ~325 controls                | PII, agency data, collaboration platforms         |
| **High**     | ~421 controls                | Law enforcement, health, financial systems        |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use the **FedRAMP SSP template** and documentation toolkit.
- Engage with a **3PAO early** to prepare for the assessment.
- Maintain **continuous monitoring documentation** from Day 1.
- Participate in **FedRAMP Connect** if seeking JAB prioritization.
