A **Blue Team Playbook** is a structured guide used by defenders to respond to security incidents, detect threats, and improve organizational resilience. It includes **detection rules**, **response actions**, **log sources**, and **procedural checklists** for common threats.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Standardize **incident response procedures**
- Provide **detection and containment guidelines**
- Improve **analyst speed and consistency**
- Enable **threat hunting** and post-incident reviews
- Map to **MITRE ATT&CK** and compliance requirements

> “A playbook turns chaos into action.”

## 🧱 Playbook Structure

Each playbook entry should include:

- **Playbook Title** (e.g., “Suspicious PowerShell Execution”)
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
- **Log Sources**
- **Detection Logic**
- **Severity & Triage Guidance**
- **Investigation Steps**
- **Response Actions**
- **Post-Incident Review**

---

## 📘 Sample Entry: Suspicious PowerShell Execution

### 🎯 MITRE Technique  
- `T1059.001`: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell

### 📊 Log Sources
- Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)
- Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)
- EDR telemetry

### 🔍 Detection Logic
```yaml
parent_process: WINWORD.EXE
child_process: powershell.exe
command_line_contains: base64 OR Invoke
```

### 🚨 Severity

- High (if executed via Office app or obfuscated string)

### 🔎 Investigation Steps

- Review full command-line
- Check process ancestry (parent and grandparent)
- Pivot to network activity or file drops
- Review user session history

### 🛡 Response Actions

- Kill offending process
- Isolate endpoint
- Capture memory/image (Volatility, EDR snapshot)
- Block user credentials (if lateral movement detected)

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Are macro protections enabled?
- Are logs enriched and parsed correctly?
- Are similar behaviors seen elsewhere?

## 🛠 Recommended Playbooks to Create

|Category|Example Playbooks|
|---|---|
|**Credential Access**|Mimikatz use, LSASS access, brute force|
|**Lateral Movement**|PsExec, WMI, RDP login anomalies|
|**Execution**|PowerShell, LOLBins, MSIExec abuse|
|**Persistence**|Registry Run Keys, new services, scheduled tasks|
|**Data Exfiltration**|Suspicious compression + outbound traffic|
|**Reconnaissance**|Active Directory enumeration, user listing|
|**Defense Evasion**|Log clearing, encoded commands, `bypass` flags|

## 🧩 Detection Engineering Templates

### 🔍 Generic Process Anomaly Rule
```
if parent_process IN [WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE]
and child_process == powershell.exe
and command_line_contains == base64 or Invoke-Expression:
    alert "Possible Macro + PowerShell Execution"
```

### 🔍 Account Abuse
```
if EventID == 4625
and username == admin
and count > 10 in 5 minutes:
    alert "Brute force attempt"
```
