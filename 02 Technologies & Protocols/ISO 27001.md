**ISO/IEC 27001** is an internationally recognized **information security standard** that outlines the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.

It provides a **risk-based, systematic approach** to managing sensitive information so that it remains secure ‚Äî covering people, processes, and IT systems.

## üß∞ Core Components

### 1. **ISMS Framework**

- A set of **policies, procedures, and controls** designed to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
- Built on the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** model.

### 2. **Annex A Controls (Reference Control Objectives)**

ISO/IEC 27001 includes **93 controls** organized into **4 themes** (post-2022 revision):

| Theme               | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Organizational**  | Governance, roles, mobile use, remote work   |
| **People**          | Background checks, awareness, responsibilities |
| **Physical**        | Physical security, equipment, secure zones   |
| **Technological**   | Cryptography, access control, logging, backups |

## üîÅ PDCA Model

| Phase  | Description                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plan**   | Establish ISMS objectives, risk assessment, and controls |
| **Do**     | Implement policies, procedures, and security controls    |
| **Check**  | Monitor, audit, and review ISMS performance              |
| **Act**    | Take corrective actions and continuously improve         |

## üß± Key Requirements (Clause 4‚Äì10)

| Clause | Description                                   |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 4      | Context of the organization                   |
| 5      | Leadership and commitment                     |
| 6      | Risk management and planning                  |
| 7      | Support (resources, awareness, communication) |
| 8      | Operation of ISMS                             |
| 9      | Performance evaluation                        |
| 10     | Improvement and corrective actions            |

## üìà Certification Process

1. **Gap Analysis (optional)** ‚Äì Assess current posture against ISO 27001.
2. **Stage 1 Audit** ‚Äì Review ISMS documentation.
3. **Stage 2 Audit** ‚Äì On-site audit to verify implementation.
4. **Certification Granted** ‚Äì If compliant, valid for 3 years.
5. **Surveillance Audits** ‚Äì Conducted annually during the 3-year cycle.
