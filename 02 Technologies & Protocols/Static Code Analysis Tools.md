**Static Code Analysis** involves examining source code without executing it to identify security flaws, logic errors, or policy violations. It's commonly used in **DevSecOps**, **secure SDLC**, and **code quality assurance**.

These tools are essential for detecting **CWE-classified weaknesses** early in the development lifecycle.

## üéØ Purpose of Static Code Analysis

- Identify **security vulnerabilities** before code is run
- Detect violations of **coding standards** or **best practices**
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for **shift-left security**
- Improve **code quality**, maintainability, and reduce technical debt
- Map weaknesses to **CWE**, **OWASP Top 10**, and **SANS Top 25**

## üîç What Static Analysis Can Detect

| Issue Type                      | Examples                                                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Validation Flaws**       | XSS, SQL Injection, buffer overflows                    |
| **Insecure API Usage**          | Weak crypto functions, dangerous system calls            |
| **Access Control Issues**        | Hardcoded credentials, privilege escalation paths        |
| **Code Smells**                 | Dead code, unreachable branches, duplication              |
| **Standards Violations**         | MISRA, OWASP ASVS, CERT C, custom coding guidelines      |

## üîÅ Integration in DevSecOps

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Block insecure code before commit (`Husky`, `pre-commit`)
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Run scans on every pull request/build
- **IDE Plugins**: Immediate feedback to developers during coding
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated scanning via `.yml` workflows

---

## üõ° Best Practices

- Customize rulesets to match your org‚Äôs threat model
- Regularly update the tool to detect new CWE/OWASP risks
- Tune rules to reduce false positives (especially in legacy code)
- Use **code review + static analysis** for stronger assurance
- Pair with **dynamic testing** (DAST) for full-spectrum coverage

## üß† Static vs Dynamic Analysis

| Aspect             | Static Code Analysis                | Dynamic Analysis (DAST)               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **When**           | Pre-deployment (during coding)       | Post-deployment (runtime testing)     |
| **How**            | Examines source code                 | Monitors behavior during execution    |
| **Speed**          | Fast; integrates with builds         | Slower; needs deployed environment    |
| **Depth**          | May miss runtime bugs                | May miss hidden/unreachable flaws     |
