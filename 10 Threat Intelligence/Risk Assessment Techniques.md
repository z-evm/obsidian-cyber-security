Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to an organization's information systems. It is a core component of any cybersecurity framework.

## üéØ Purpose of Risk Assessment

- Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
- Evaluate the impact and likelihood of security incidents.
- Inform risk response and control implementation.
- Support **business continuity** and **regulatory compliance**.

## üß∞ Common Risk Assessment Techniques

### 1. **Quantitative Risk Assessment**
- **Description**: Uses numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts) to determine risk levels.
- **Metrics Used**:
  - **AV (Asset Value)**: Monetary value of an asset.
  - **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)**: How often a threat is expected to occur.
  - **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)**: Expected monetary loss from a single incident. `SLE = AV √ó EF`
  - **EF (Exposure Factor)**: Percentage of asset lost per incident.
  - **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)**: Expected yearly loss. `ALE = SLE √ó ARO`
- **Pros**: Objective, useful for budgeting.
- **Cons**: Requires accurate data, time-consuming.

### 2. **Qualitative Risk Assessment**
- **Description**: Uses subjective values (e.g., high, medium, low) to prioritize risk.
- **Common Tools**:
  - **Risk Matrix** (Likelihood vs. Impact)
  - **Expert Judgment**
  - **Interviews and Surveys**
- **Pros**: Quick, easier to implement.
- **Cons**: Subjective, less precise.

### 3. **Semi-Quantitative Assessment**
- **Description**: Blends elements of both qualitative and quantitative assessments.
- **Example**: Using a scale (e.g., 1‚Äì5) for impact and likelihood, then multiplying for a risk score.

| Technique               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Modeling**     | Identifies possible attackers, assets, and attack vectors.                  |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Scans for known weaknesses in systems or software.                          |
| **Penetration Testing** | Simulated attacks to find exploitable vulnerabilities.                      |
| **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** | Identifies critical assets/processes and the impact of disruption.         |
| **Risk Register**       | A document/log tracking identified risks, their impact, and mitigations.    |
| **SWOT Analysis**       | Assesses Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.                 |
| **Likelihood/Impact Charts** | Visualizes risk levels to assist in prioritization.                         |
| **Gap Analysis**        | Identifies the gap between current security posture and desired state.      |

## üîê Key Risk Concepts

- **Risk Appetite**: The amount and type of risk an organization is willing to accept.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Acceptable deviation from risk appetite.
- **Residual Risk**: Remaining risk after controls are implemented.
- **Inherent Risk**: Risk before any mitigations.
- **Control Effectiveness**: How well a control reduces risk.

## üß± Risk Treatment Options

| Option         | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Mitigation** | Apply controls to reduce risk.                   |
| **Transfer**   | Share risk (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).       |
| **Avoidance**  | Eliminate the risk entirely (e.g., remove asset).|
| **Acceptance** | Acknowledge and live with the risk.              |
