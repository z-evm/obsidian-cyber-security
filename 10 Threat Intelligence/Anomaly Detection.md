> Anomaly Detection refers to the identification of unusual or unexpected behavior in systems, users, or network traffic that may indicate security threats, misconfigurations, or policy violations.

## üìå What Is Anomaly Detection?

- Uses **statistical**, **machine learning**, or **heuristic** techniques to establish a **baseline of normal behavior**.
- Detects **deviations** that may signify:
  - Cyberattacks
  - Insider threats
  - System failures
  - Misuse or fraud

| Concept                 | Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline**             | Profile of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù operations based on time, user, location, etc. |
| **Deviation**            | Activity that strays significantly from the baseline             |
| **Alert Threshold**      | Sensitivity setting for triggering detection                     |
| **False Positives/Negatives** | Incorrect alerts (e.g., benign flagged as malicious)        |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Anomaly vs Signature-Based Detection

| Feature                 | Anomaly-Based                          | Signature-Based                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Detection Capability**| Detects unknown threats                | Detects known threats               |
| **False Positives**     | Higher (needs tuning)                  | Lower for known attacks             |
| **Adaptability**        | Learns over time                       | Requires manual signature updates   |
| **Use Cases**           | Insider threats, zero-day attacks      | Malware, known exploits             |
