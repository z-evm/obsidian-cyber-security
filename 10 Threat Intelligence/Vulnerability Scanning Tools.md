**Vulnerability Scanning Tools** are software utilities designed to discover, evaluate, and report on security flaws across networks, systems, and applications. These tools support proactive defense by identifying misconfigurations, missing patches, weak policies, and exploitable code.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Identify known and unknown vulnerabilities
- Assist in compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Support penetration testing and risk assessments
- Validate security control effectiveness
- Provide remediation guidance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations When Using Tools

| Factor           | Explanation                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**        | Ensure legal and organizational approval before scanning     |
| **False Positives** | Validate findings manually or with other tools             |
| **Resource Impact** | Some scans (e.g., DAST) can crash unstable systems         |
| **Credentials**  | Authenticated scans yield deeper, more accurate results       |
| **Regular Use**  | Schedule scans regularly, especially post-patch or config changes |

## üõ°Ô∏è Role in Cybersecurity Lifecycle

- **Identify**: Surface known vulnerabilities
- **Protect**: Inform patching and control implementation
- **Detect**: Feed alerts into monitoring tools
- **Respond**: Prioritize remediation based on severity
- **Recover**: Verify fixes through re-scanning
