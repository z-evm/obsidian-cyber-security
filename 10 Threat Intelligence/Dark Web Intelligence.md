The **Dark Web** is a hidden part of the internet not indexed by traditional search engines and only accessible through anonymizing networks like **Tor (The Onion Router)**. It hosts a range of content, from private forums and whistleblower platforms to illicit marketplaces and threat actor communications.

## üéØ Purpose of Dark Web Intelligence

**Dark Web Intelligence (DWI)** refers to the process of monitoring, collecting, and analyzing information from dark web sources to identify threats and enhance cybersecurity posture.

Key goals:
- Early detection of data breaches, leaks, and exposed credentials.
- Identification of planned cyberattacks or threat actor intentions.
- Tracking the sale of malware, exploits, and illicit services.
- Gathering Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from underground forums.
