**CWE** is a categorized list of software weaknesses maintained by [MITRE](https://cwe.mitre.org). It provides a common language for describing software security flaws that can lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., those indexed as CVEs).

---

## üéØ Purpose of CWE

- Standardize descriptions of software weaknesses
- Support **secure software development** and **code analysis**
- Help prioritize software risk during **vulnerability management**
- Provide **taxonomy for root cause analysis** of security flaws

## üß¨ CWE vs CVE vs CVSS

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CWE**  | Describes the **type or pattern** of software weakness (e.g., buffer overflow) |
| **CVE**  | Documents **individual instances** of exploitable vulnerabilities |
| **CVSS** | Provides a **severity score** for CVEs based on impact and exploitability |

> üìå Think of CWE as *"what's wrong"*, CVE as *"where it happened"*, and CVSS as *"how bad it is."*

## üõ† CWE in Practice

| Area                     | Application Example                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Code Analysis** | Tools (e.g., SonarQube, Fortify, CodeQL) flag CWEs in codebases    |
| **Secure SDLC**          | Dev teams use CWE to write secure code and verify with checklists  |
| **Threat Modeling**      | Identify possible CWEs in design (e.g., CWE-601: Open Redirects)    |
| **Exploit Research**     | Track common flaw types in 0-days and PoC exploits                  |
| **Compliance & Audit**   | CWE alignment used for ISO, NIST, and PCI-DSS software security     |

## üß† CWE Classifications

- **Weakness Class**: General group (e.g., Input Validation Errors)
- **Base Weakness**: Abstract flaw pattern (e.g., CWE-20: Input Validation)
- **Variant Weakness**: Specific form (e.g., CWE-116: Improper Output Encoding)

---

## üîê Relation to MITRE ATT&CK

- CWEs describe **coding flaws**, while MITRE ATT&CK describes **attacker behaviors**
- Together, they help map **how flaws are exploited** during real-world attacks
