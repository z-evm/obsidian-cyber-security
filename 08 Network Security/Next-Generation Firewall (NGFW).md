A **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)** is an advanced security appliance that combines **traditional firewall capabilities** with **deep packet inspection (DPI)**, **application awareness**, and **intrusion prevention**, offering **context-aware control** over traffic.

NGFWs operate at **Layers 3, 4, and 7**, enabling modern security enforcement across applications, users, and content.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of NGFW

- Block **known and unknown threats** at the application level.
- Enforce **user-aware** and **content-aware** security policies.
- Detect and prevent **zero-day exploits** and **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**.
- Replace or augment **legacy firewalls and UTM** solutions.

## 🧱 Key Features of NGFW

| Feature                        | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stateful Packet Filtering**  | Traditional Layer 3–4 inspection                                   |
| **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**| Examines payloads and protocol violations                         |
| **Application Awareness**      | Identifies and controls apps like Dropbox, Zoom, BitTorrent        |
| **User Identity Integration**  | Enforces policies based on AD, LDAP, SSO users                     |
| **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**| Detects and blocks known vulnerabilities                    |
| **TLS/SSL Decryption**         | Inspects encrypted traffic                                         |
| **URL Filtering**              | Blocks access to malicious or restricted categories                |
| **Threat Intelligence**        | Leverages cloud-based threat feeds                                 |
| **Sandboxing**                 | Isolates suspicious files for behavioral analysis (ATP)            |

## 🔐 NGFW vs Traditional Firewall

| Feature                    | Traditional Firewall         | Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)       |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Layer Support              | Layer 3–4 (IP, port)          | Layer 3–7 (app, user, content)         |
| Application Control        | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                 |
| IPS/IDS Integration        | ❌ No                         | ✅ Built-in or tightly integrated      |
| User Awareness             | ❌ IP-based only              | ✅ User identity & roles               |
| Malware/Sandbox Detection  | ❌ Not included               | ✅ ATP and advanced malware support    |
| Cloud Intelligence         | ❌ Limited                    | ✅ Real-time threat feeds              |
