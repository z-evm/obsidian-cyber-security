A **Secure Email Gateway (SEG)** is a security solution that **monitors and filters inbound and outbound email traffic** to protect organizations from threats like phishing, malware, spam, and data loss.

---

## 🛡 What Does a SEG Do?

**Primary Functions:**
- Block **malicious content** (malware, viruses, ransomware)
- Detect and quarantine **phishing** attempts
- Enforce **compliance policies** (e.g., content filters, DLP)
- Provide **email encryption** for sensitive content
- Scan **outbound** messages to prevent data leakage

## 🔒 How SEGs Fit in Email Security Architecture

A SEG typically sits **between the internet and the mail server**, acting as a **proxy**:

###### Internet 🌐 → SEG 🔐 → Mail Server (e.g., Microsoft 365, Exchange)


- Can be cloud-based or on-premises
- Often used **with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** for enhanced identity validation

## 🔧 Examples of SEG Solutions

- **Proofpoint Email Protection**
- **Mimecast**
- **Cisco Email Security**
- **Barracuda Email Security Gateway**
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**
- **Fortinet FortiMail**

## 🧪 Common Attack Types Mitigated

| Attack Type         | SEG Response                                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing**        | Link/URL rewriting, quarantine, impersonation detection |
| **Spoofing**        | SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement                             |
| **Malware**         | Sandboxing, AV scanning                                |
| **Spam**            | Bayesian filters, sender reputation, heuristics        |
| **Zero-day threats**| Behavior-based detection, threat intel feeds           |

## 🧱 SEG vs. Email Security Add-ons

| Solution Type   | Scope                            | Examples                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **SEG**          | Full gateway filtering            | Proofpoint, Mimecast, Cisco            |
| **Add-on**       | Post-delivery scanning/enrichment | Microsoft Defender, Avanan, IRONSCALES |

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

- SEGs should be **regularly updated** with new threat signatures and rules.
- **False positives** must be monitored to avoid email delivery issues.
- **User awareness training** complements SEG effectiveness.
