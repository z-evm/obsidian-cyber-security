Understanding **ports and protocols** is fundamental to network security, firewall configuration, intrusion detection, and vulnerability management. Each protocol operates on a well-defined port, facilitating communication between hosts and services.

---

## üéØ Key Concepts

- **Protocol**: A set of rules governing data exchange (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- **Port Number**: A numerical identifier for a service (ranges from 0‚Äì65535).
- **Well-Known Ports**: Ports 0‚Äì1023, assigned by IANA.
- **Registered Ports**: Ports 1024‚Äì49151, used by vendors/applications.
- **Dynamic/Private Ports**: 49152‚Äì65535, used temporarily for client-side connections.

## üîç Port Scanning Tools

- `nmap` ‚Äì Open-source port scanner and network mapper
- `netstat` ‚Äì Lists current network connections (local machine)
- `ss` ‚Äì Fast socket stats (Linux alternative to netstat)
- `tcpdump` ‚Äì Packet capture for live analysis

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Implications

- **Open Ports = Attack Surface**
  - Each open port is a potential entry point.
- **Unused services should be disabled.**
- **Firewalls** should strictly control inbound/outbound ports.
- Common attacks include:
  - Port Scanning (recon)
  - Exploiting vulnerable services (e.g., SMB, Telnet)
  - Banner grabbing (to fingerprint service versions)

---

## üîê Port-Based Security

- **Firewall Rules**: Allow/block ports per policy
- **ACLs**: Enforce port restrictions on routers/switches
- **IDS/IPS Signatures**: Detect specific port behavior
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Test for known exploits on common ports

## ‚úÖ To Do

- [ ] Create port/protocol flashcards for exam prep
- [ ] Add filtering rules for common services (e.g., iptables/Windows Firewall)
- [ ] Document common vulnerable services (e.g., Telnet, SMBv1)
