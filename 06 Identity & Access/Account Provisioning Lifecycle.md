The **Account Provisioning Lifecycle** defines the structured process for **creating, managing, and deactivating user accounts** across an organization‚Äôs IT systems. It ensures that **access is granted appropriately**, **maintained securely**, and **revoked promptly**‚Äîall of which are vital for **identity governance** and **compliance**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Ensure **appropriate access** is granted based on role and responsibility  
- Prevent **orphaned**, **stale**, or **overprivileged accounts**  
- Automate user lifecycle actions to reduce risk and overhead  
- Support compliance with standards like **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, **HIPAA**, and **SOX**

---

## üîÅ Lifecycle Stages

### 1. üÜï Provisioning

- Triggered by onboarding, new hire, contractor setup  
- Actions:
  - Identity verification / [[Identity Proofing]]  
  - Create AD, email, and app accounts  
  - Assign roles/groups via RBAC or ABAC  
  - Issue credentials and enable MFA  
  - Log account creation in IAM or ticketing system

### 2. üîÑ Maintenance

- Periodic review of:
  - Role changes (promotion, department transfer)  
  - Access rights and entitlements  
  - Group membership and permissions  
- Triggered by internal moves, audits, or policy changes

### 3. üõë De-Provisioning

- Triggered by termination, contract end, or inactivity  
- Actions:
  - Disable account immediately (AD, VPN, apps)  
  - Revoke tokens, keys, and remote access  
  - Archive or transfer user data  
  - Log actions for auditing and compliance  
  - Trigger alerts for failed/forgotten removals
