**Spyware** is a category of malware designed to covertly gather information about a user, system, or organization without their knowledge or consent. It often operates in the background, exfiltrating sensitive data such as credentials, browsing habits, keystrokes, or communications.

> üß† *Unlike ransomware or trojans, spyware prefers to stay hidden‚Äîits power lies in persistent, silent surveillance.*
