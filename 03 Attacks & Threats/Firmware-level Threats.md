**Firmware-level threats** target the low-level software embedded in hardware devices, such as BIOS/UEFI, network cards, hard drives, and embedded controllers. These threats are extremely dangerous due to their **stealth**, **persistence**, and ability to bypass most OS-level security controls.

## üéØ Why Firmware Threats Matter

- Run **before the operating system** boots
- Often reside **outside visibility** of antivirus and EDR
- Can **reinstall malware** even after OS reinstallation
- May **disable Secure Boot**, inject bootkits, or spy on users
- Require specialized tools to **detect and remediate**

## üß∞ Common Firmware Targets

| Firmware Component        | Description                                             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **BIOS/UEFI**              | Controls boot process; susceptible to rootkits and bootkits |
| **Network Interface Card (NIC)** | Can be reflashed to intercept or redirect traffic     |
| **Hard Drive/SSD Controller** | Can hide malicious code or control firmware-based operations |
| **GPU/Peripheral Firmware**   | May allow attackers to control rendering or device behavior |
| **Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs)** | Used in servers; can provide OOB access    |

## üß™ Attack Vectors

| Vector                    | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Malicious Firmware Updates** | Vendor compromise or update hijacking                          |
| **Exploiting Flashing Tools**  | Abuse vendor tools that allow reflashing without checks         |
| **Supply Chain Attacks**       | Firmware is tampered with before delivery                       |
| **DMA Attacks (e.g., via Thunderbolt)** | Exploit direct memory access before OS protection kicks in |

## üî• Notable Firmware Threats

| Threat/Tool         | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LoJax (APT28)**    | First known UEFI rootkit in the wild; persisted in SPI flash |
| **MoonBounce (APT41)** | Firmware implant in UEFI discovered by Kaspersky           |
| **Hacking Team UEFI rootkit** | Commercial spyware with boot persistence             |
| **Equation Group HDD implants** | Malware embedded in HDD controller firmware       |

## üß© Capabilities of Firmware Malware

- **Bypass OS-level defenses**
- **Reinfect the system post-cleaning**
- Establish **stealthy persistence**
- Monitor keystrokes, files, or traffic from boot
- Intercept BIOS passwords or inject payloads into OS memory

## üîç Detection & Forensics

| Technique/Tool          | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chipsec Framework**     | Intel open-source tool to validate firmware integrity       |
| **Firmware Integrity Verification** | Compare firmware images with known-good versions |
| **UEFI Scanner (Kaspersky)** | Detect known UEFI threats                                |
| **Memory Forensics**      | Find implants injected into runtime memory                  |
| **Hardware-Level Inspection** | Requires SPI flash dump or logic analyzer               |

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

| Control Type       | Measures                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**     | Enable Secure Boot, disable unsigned BIOS updates, use trusted hardware |
| **Detective**      | Monitor firmware update logs, use firmware scanning tools                |
| **Corrective**     | Reflash firmware from known-good copy, isolate compromised devices       |
| **Compensating**   | Hardware root of trust (e.g., Intel Boot Guard, TPM)                     |
