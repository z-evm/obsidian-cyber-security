**Social engineering reconnaissance** is the process of gathering detailed information about a target organization or individual in preparation for **psychological or human-layer attacks**. This phase enables attackers (or ethical testers) to craft convincing pretexts and exploit trust-based vulnerabilities.

> üß† *You can‚Äôt hack humans without first understanding them.*

## üéØ Goals of Social Engineering Recon

- Identify **targets** (individuals, departments, vendors)
- Understand **business operations** and communication flows
- Uncover **technical and cultural insights** (e.g., internal lingo, tools used)
- Discover **security gaps** in human behavior or physical access

## üé≠ Pretext Development

Use gathered recon to craft scenarios such as:

- IT support impersonation
- Vendor or auditor visits
- HR follow-up calls
- Fake delivery or badge access requests
- Event invitations or conference connections

> üß™ Test employees' ability to verify legitimacy under pressure.

## üîç Common Tools & Platforms

| Tool / Site         | Use Case                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **LinkedIn**        | Org charts, job titles, internal lingo        |
| **Hunter.io**       | Email format discovery                        |
| **HaveIBeenPwned**  | Credential breach history                     |
| **Google Dorks**    | `inurl:login site:company.com`                |
| **Recon-ng / Maltego** | Graph-based recon & relationship mapping |
| **Creepy / LittleSis** | Geo-social tracking (less common)          |

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Recommendations

- Limit public exposure of staff details
- Provide regular security awareness training
- Implement email verification policies (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Enforce ID checks for vendors and third parties
- Create policies for reporting suspicious interactions

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Engagement Rules

- Obtain **written authorization** for testing
- Define **limits of impersonation** (no emergency services, threats)
- Avoid emotional manipulation of **high-risk individuals**
- Follow up with **lessons learned and user feedback**
