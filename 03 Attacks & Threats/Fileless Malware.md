**Fileless malware** is a type of malicious code that operates entirely in memory, leaving little to no trace on the file system. It is primarily designed to evade traditional antivirus and signature-based detection methods.

## üß† Key Characteristics

- **No executable file written to disk** ‚Äî avoids traditional file-based scanning
- **Resides in volatile memory (RAM)** ‚Äî disappears upon reboot (unless paired with persistence mechanisms)
- **Leverages legitimate system tools** ‚Äî often uses PowerShell, WMI, macros, or native Windows binaries (LOLbins)
- **Common in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Techniques

| Technique                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PowerShell attacks**         | Executes malicious code via script or command-line                         |
| **Macro-based payloads**       | Malicious macros in Office docs trigger memory-resident code               |
| **WMI abuse**                  | Uses Windows Management Instrumentation to execute/inject code             |
| **Reflective DLL injection**   | Loads a DLL directly into memory, avoiding disk                             |
| **Process hollowing**          | Suspends legitimate process and replaces its code in memory                 |
| **Living off the land (LOTL)** | Abuse of native tools like `cmd`, `powershell`, `regsvr32`, `rundll32`, etc. |

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

| Control Type       | Example Measures                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**     | Disable macros, restrict PowerShell, application whitelisting     |
| **Detective**      | EDR solutions, behavior analytics, memory scanning                |
| **Corrective**     | Kill process, logoff/cleanup scripts, isolate host                |
| **Compensating**   | Implement strict privilege controls, user awareness training      |

## üß™ Indicators of Fileless Activity

- PowerShell or `wmic` executions with suspicious parameters
- Unusual parent-child process relationships (e.g., `winword.exe ‚Üí powershell.exe`)
- Unexpected registry key changes (for persistence)
- Abnormal memory usage patterns

## üî¨ Real-World Example

### ‚öîÔ∏è Astaroth (Brazilian banking trojan)

- Operated via WMI and LOLBins
- Avoided downloading any malicious executables
- Injected into legitimate processes like `explorer.exe`

## üè∞ Security Controls Mapping (Example)

| Layer         | Control                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Endpoint      | EDR, PowerShell logging, AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) |
| Network       | Network segmentation, behavioral firewall rules |
| Application   | Macro sandboxing, Office file restrictions      |
| User Training | Phishing awareness, safe document handling      |
