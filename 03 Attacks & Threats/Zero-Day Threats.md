A **zero-day threat** refers to a vulnerability in software, hardware, or firmware that is **unknown to the vendor** or has **no available patch** at the time of discovery or exploitation. These threats are especially dangerous because attackers exploit them **before defenders are aware** or able to respond.

## üö® What Is a Zero-Day?

| Term             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero-Day Vulnerability** | A security flaw that is unknown to the vendor                      |
| **Zero-Day Exploit**       | Code or technique used by attackers to abuse the flaw              |
| **Zero-Day Attack**        | Real-world deployment of the exploit against a target              |

> The term "zero-day" implies **zero days of warning or mitigation**.

## üß¨ Life Cycle of a Zero-Day Exploit

1. üîç **Discovery** ‚Äì Found by a researcher or attacker.
2. üõ† **Weaponization** ‚Äì Code is developed to exploit the flaw.
3. üéØ **Deployment** ‚Äì Attack is launched (e.g., phishing, drive-by download).
4. üîí **Disclosure** ‚Äì Vendor becomes aware (via researcher or incident).
5. üß© **Patch Released** ‚Äì Vulnerability is mitigated with a fix.
6. üîÅ **Post-Day** ‚Äì Now considered a "N-day" threat (known and patchable).

## üîê Common Attack Vectors

| Vector            | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| üìß **Email (Phishing)** | Deliver zero-day payload via attachment or link |
| üåê **Web Browsers**     | Drive-by downloads, JavaScript exploits         |
| üñ• **Application Bugs** | Office, PDF, Java, Adobe, and media players     |
| üì° **Network Services** | Exploit unpatched services like RDP, SMB        |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud/Zero Trust** | Exploits in SaaS or identity providers          |

## ‚öîÔ∏è Detection Challenges

- Signature-based AV is ineffective against unknown exploits
- Behavior may appear legitimate
- Often require:
  - **Heuristic analysis**
  - **Anomaly detection**
  - **Threat intelligence feeds**
  - **Sandboxing**

## üõ° Defense Strategies

| Strategy                 | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| üß± **Defense in Depth**   | Multiple layers (SEG, EDR, IDS/IPS, sandboxing)                |
| üì§ **Patch Management**   | Rapid deployment of vendor updates when released               |
| üö´ **Application Whitelisting** | Only allow known-safe apps and code execution              |
| üìö **Threat Intelligence**| Use feeds to stay ahead of emerging attack patterns            |
| üß™ **Sandboxing**         | Detonate suspicious files in isolated environments             |
| üë• **User Training**      | Identify phishing, abnormal behavior, and suspicious content   |

## üîé Example: Zero-Day in the Wild

**CVE-2025-53770 ‚Äì SharePoint Remote Code Execution**
- **Discovered:** July 2025
- **Exploit:** Used in the wild before Microsoft released a patch
- **Delivery:** Malicious document upload exploiting SharePoint parsing logic
- **Mitigation:** Block unknown file types, restrict upload privileges, monitor logs

> Always monitor official feeds (e.g., US-CERT, Microsoft, CISA KEVs) for zero-day alerts.
