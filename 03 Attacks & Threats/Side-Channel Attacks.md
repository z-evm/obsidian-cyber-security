Side-channel attacks exploit indirect information (such as timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions) leaked during computation to extract sensitive data. These attacks do not rely on software vulnerabilities but on observing physical characteristics of a system.

## üß¨ What Makes Side-Channel Attacks Dangerous?

- Can bypass traditional access controls.
- Exploit characteristics inherent to hardware and microarchitecture.
- Often leave little or no trace in software logs.
- Require advanced but increasingly affordable tools (oscilloscopes, EM probes, etc.).

## üîç Categories of Side-Channel Attacks

### 1. **Timing Attacks**
- Measure time differences in operations (e.g., cryptographic algorithms).
- **Target**: RSA, AES, password comparison functions.

### 2. **Power Analysis**
- Analyze power consumption patterns of devices during computations.
- **Variants**:
  - Simple Power Analysis (SPA)
  - Differential Power Analysis (DPA)

### 3. **Electromagnetic (EM) Emissions**
- Use EM signals emitted by hardware to infer processed data.
- **Example**: TEMPEST attacks.

### 4. **Cache-Based Attacks**
- Exploit CPU cache behavior to extract data.
- **Examples**:
  - Flush+Reload
  - Prime+Probe
  - Evict+Time

### 5. **Branch Prediction & Speculative Execution**
- Abuse speculative instruction execution for data leakage.
- **Examples**:
  - Spectre
  - Meltdown
  - ZombieLoad
  - Foreshadow (L1TF)

### 6. **Acoustic & Optical Side-Channels**
- Rare, but possible:
  - Acoustic analysis of CPU/keyboard sounds.
  - Optical observation of LED activity.
