A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a victim's computer remotely, often without their knowledge. RATs provide full administrative control and are commonly used for **surveillance**, **data theft**, and **lateral movement** within a compromised network.

## üéØ Purpose of a RAT

- Establish covert **remote control** over infected systems
- Bypass security controls using legitimate protocols (RDP, HTTP, TCP)
- Enable persistent access for **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**
- Exfiltrate sensitive data or deploy additional malware

## üîç Detection Techniques

| Method                    | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Monitoring**     | Look for beaconing or outbound connections to C2 IPs         |
| **EDR Tools**              | Detect process injection, persistence mechanisms             |
| **SIEM Correlation**       | Identify suspicious behaviors across hosts                   |
| **Heuristic/Behavioral AV**| Detect command and control behaviors rather than signatures  |
| **Anomaly Detection**      | Flag unusual process relationships (e.g., `explorer.exe ‚Üí powershell.exe`) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

| Control Type     | Example Measures                                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**   | Disable macros, restrict scripting engines, application whitelisting   |
| **Detective**    | Enable PowerShell logging, monitor registry and startup entries        |
| **Corrective**   | Quarantine infected host, revoke compromised credentials               |
| **Compensating** | Isolate high-value systems, use sandboxing for user applications       |

## üß∑ Persistence Techniques Used by RATs

- Registry Run keys (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`)
- Scheduled tasks or services
- DLL side-loading or code injection into legitimate processes
- Malicious browser extensions or startup folders
