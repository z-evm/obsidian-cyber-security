A hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM) is a critical layer in virtualization technology that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host. Given its central role, compromising the hypervisor can give an attacker control over all hosted VMs.

## üß± Types of Hypervisors

| Type      | Description                                | Examples                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Type 1**| Bare-metal hypervisor running directly on hardware | VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen |
| **Type 2**| Hosted hypervisor running within a host OS | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation    |

> üîê Type 1 hypervisors offer better security isolation and performance.

## üö® Threats to Hypervisors

### 1. **VM Escape**
- Attacker breaks out of a VM and gains access to the host or other VMs.
- **Examples**: VENOM (CVE-2015-3456), Spectre/Meltdown class bugs.

### 2. **Hypervisor Vulnerabilities**
- Bugs in the hypervisor code can be exploited for:
  - Privilege escalation
  - Arbitrary code execution
  - Denial of Service (DoS)

### 3. **Management Interface Exploits**
- Attackers target:
  - vCenter (VMware)
  - Hyper-V Manager
  - Cloud consoles (AWS, Azure)

### 4. **Misconfigurations**
- Weak access control to management APIs.
- Lack of auditing/logging.
- Insecure default settings.

### 5. **Side-Channel Attacks**
- Exploits hardware-level leakage in shared environments.
- **Examples**: Cache timing attacks, L1TF, MDS.

## üõ° Hardening Hypervisor Security

| Area                     | Recommended Practice                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**       | Use least privilege, RBAC, MFA on consoles         |
| **Patch Management**     | Regularly update hypervisor software and firmware  |
| **Secure Configuration** | Disable unused services/interfaces                 |
| **Segmentation**         | Isolate management network from guest traffic      |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Enable auditing of admin actions & system events   |
| **Snapshot Security**    | Encrypt, limit access, and securely store backups  |
| **Hardware Protections** | Enable Secure Boot, TPM, and CPU mitigations       |

## üß∞ Tools and Controls

- **VMware vSphere Hardening Guidelines**
- **Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)**
- **OpenSCAP** for Linux-based hypervisors
- **CIS Benchmarks** for hypervisor configurations
- **TPM/Measured Boot** to validate hypervisor integrity

---

## ‚òÅ Hypervisor Security in Cloud Environments

- **Cloud Hypervisors** (e.g., Xen/KVM in AWS, Hyper-V in Azure) must be hardened at the provider level.
- **Customer Responsibility** (in shared responsibility model):
  - Secure VM OS.
  - Harden remote console/API access.
  - Monitor inter-VM traffic if permitted.
