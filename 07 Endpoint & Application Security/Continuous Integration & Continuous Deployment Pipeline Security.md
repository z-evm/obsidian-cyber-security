**CI/CD Pipeline Security** focuses on securing the tools, processes, and environments involved in **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**. These pipelines automate software delivery but also introduce new **attack surfaces** and **supply chain risks**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Protect **build and deployment processes** from compromise.
- Prevent **unauthorized code changes**, secrets exposure, or malicious artifacts.
- Ensure **integrity and trust** in code moving from development to production.
- Enforce **security gates** and controls within automated workflows.

## üß± CI/CD Pipeline Stages (Security View)

| Stage            | Description                              | Security Considerations                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Control** | Store and manage code (e.g., Git)        | Branch protection, signed commits, access control           |
| **Build**         | Compile and package code                  | Isolate build environments, scan for secrets and malware    |
| **Test**          | Automated testing (unit, integration)     | Static/Dynamic scans, dependency checking                   |
| **Artifact Storage** | Store build outputs (e.g., containers) | Integrity validation, access control, signed artifacts      |
| **Deploy**        | Push to test/staging/production          | Least privilege IAM, environment isolation, audit logs      |

## üîê Key Threats to CI/CD

| Threat                            | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Credential leakage**            | Secrets or tokens hard-coded in repos or CI configs                 |
| **Malicious code injection**      | Attacker inserts code into the pipeline or supply chain             |
| **Unvalidated dependencies**      | Use of vulnerable or malicious open-source packages                 |
| **Compromised runners/agents**    | Attacker gains control over the build environment                   |
| **Overprivileged tokens and roles** | CI/CD tool or script has excessive permissions                     |
| **Pipeline spoofing or bypass**   | Unauthorized deployments without proper validation                  |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls for CI/CD

### üîê Identity and Access Control
- Enforce **least privilege** for service accounts and CI/CD tools  
- Use **short-lived tokens** or **OIDC-based auth**  
- Restrict **write access** to protected branches

### üîç Code and Artifact Security
- Require **signed commits** and **code reviews**
- Integrate **SAST, DAST, and SCA** tools into pipelines
- Store artifacts in **signed, immutable repositories** (e.g., Amazon ECR, JFrog Artifactory)

### üß™ Testing and Validation
- Gate builds based on **security scan results**
- Automate **dependency vulnerability checks** (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk)

### üîê Secret Management
- Use secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Scan for hard-coded secrets using tools like **TruffleHog** or **GitLeaks**

### üîí Pipeline & Runner Hardening
- Run builds in **isolated containers or sandboxes**
- Use **ephemeral runners** to prevent persistent compromise
- Enable **audit logging and build provenance tracking**

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Treat pipelines as **code** ‚Äî version-controlled, reviewed, and auditable.
- Enforce **security gates** before merge or deploy stages.
- Rotate and limit **access tokens**, keys, and credentials.
- Automate **vulnerability scanning** for dependencies and containers.
- Continuously **monitor pipeline events and anomalies**.
- Include CI/CD in the organization‚Äôs **threat modeling** and **risk assessments**.
