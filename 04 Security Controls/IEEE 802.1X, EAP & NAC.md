802.1X is an IEEE standard for **port-based Network Access Control (PNAC)**, often deployed alongside **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** and **Network Access Control (NAC)** systems. Together, they authenticate, authorize, and assess devices before granting network access ‚Äî especially important in Zero Trust and enterprise environments.

---

## üîê 802.1X Overview

- Acts as a **gatekeeper at the port level**, enforcing access policies.
- Used in both **wired (LAN)** and **wireless (WLAN)** networks.
- Typically deployed with a RADIUS server for backend authentication.
- Integral to **NAC** systems for endpoint posture evaluation.

### üîÅ Authentication Flow

1. **Supplicant** (client device) requests access.
2. **Authenticator** (e.g., switch/AP) forwards request to the **Authentication Server** (usually RADIUS) via EAP.
3. Server verifies credentials and returns decision.
4. Authenticator allows or blocks network access.

| Component           | Role                                               |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Supplicant          | Client device (e.g., laptop, phone)                |
| Authenticator       | Network device (e.g., switch, WAP)                 |
| Authentication Server | Validates identity (e.g., NPS, FreeRADIUS)       |

## üîÑ EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

EAP is a **flexible authentication framework** used within **802.1X** for network access control.  
It supports multiple **credential types** ‚Äî certificates, passwords, tokens ‚Äî allowing organizations to choose the method that best fits their security and infrastructure needs.

---

### üìå Key Features
- **Framework, not a single protocol** ‚Äî defines how authentication is carried, not the method itself.
- Works with **wired, wireless, and VPN connections**.
- Typically integrated with **RADIUS** for backend authentication.
- Supports **mutual authentication** (in methods like EAP-TLS).
- Commonly used in **enterprise Wi-Fi security (WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise)**.

### üìä EAP Method Comparison

| EAP Method   | Description                                                                 | Security | Common Use Cases                                | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **EAP-TLS**  | Certificate-based; no passwords; mutual authentication                      | ‚úÖ‚úÖ       | Enterprise Wi-Fi, VPNs, Gov/Military Networks  | Strongest security; requires PKI deployment |
| **PEAP**     | Password inside TLS tunnel (often MSCHAPv2 + AD)                            | ‚úÖ        | Windows/AD environments, WPA2-Enterprise       | Easier to deploy than cert-only methods |
| **EAP-TTLS** | TLS tunnel supports passwords, tokens, or legacy auth inside                | ‚úÖ        | Mixed environments with older devices          | Flexible for migrations |
| **EAP-FAST** | Cisco-specific; uses PAC (Protected Access Credential) for lightweight auth | ‚úÖ        | Cisco network deployments                      | Lower overhead than EAP-TLS |
| **EAP-MD5**  | Password-only; no encryption of credentials                                 | ‚ùå        | Lab testing, legacy gear only                  | Vulnerable to MITM & replay |
| **LEAP**     | Legacy Cisco; weak encryption; proprietary                                  | ‚ùå        | Deprecated                                     | Easily cracked; replaced by PEAP/EAP-FAST |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes
- **Avoid** EAP-MD5 and LEAP in production ‚Äî both are obsolete and insecure.
- **EAP-TLS** is the gold standard for security, but requires a **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** for certificate issuance and management.
- Password-based EAP methods rely heavily on **password strength** and **server certificate validation** to resist MITM attacks.

## üõ† Network Access Control (NAC)

NAC **extends 802.1X** by enforcing **security policies** not only based on **who** is connecting, but also **what** is connecting and **its current security state**.  
It‚Äôs a core technology for ensuring **only trusted, compliant devices** gain access to the network.

---

### üìå Key Capabilities
- **Identity Verification** ‚Äî Authenticate users and devices before granting access.
- **Security Posture Enforcement** ‚Äî Ensure endpoints meet minimum security requirements (e.g., AV installed, patches applied).
- **Dynamic Access Control** ‚Äî Adjust network permissions based on role, device type, or compliance.
- **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äî Detect policy drift or malicious activity post-connection.
- **Automated Remediation** ‚Äî Isolate or redirect non-compliant devices to remediation networks.
