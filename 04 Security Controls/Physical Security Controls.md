**Physical Security** involves protecting physical assets such as buildings, hardware, and personnel from unauthorized access, theft, vandalism, or environmental hazards. It is a critical component of **defense-in-depth** and **security controls**.

Even the most advanced cybersecurity can be defeated by poor **physical safeguards**.

## 🎯 Purpose

> **Physical Security answers the question:**  
> _"How do we protect our physical infrastructure from disruption or compromise?"_

Goals:
- Prevent unauthorized physical access to systems and data
- Protect personnel, equipment, and facilities
- Detect and respond to physical security incidents
- Support compliance and organizational resilience

## 🧱 Layers of Physical Security (Defense in Depth)

| Layer               | Examples                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perimeter Controls** | Fencing, gates, security guards, bollards              |
| **Building Controls**  | Badge readers, security cameras, mantraps              |
| **Room Controls**      | Locked server rooms, restricted lab access             |
| **Rack or Device Controls** | Locking racks, cable locks, BIOS passwords     |
| **Environmental Controls** | Fire suppression, HVAC, flood detection          |

## 🛡 Common Physical Security Controls

| Control Type        | Description                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deterrent**         | Discourage potential intruders                         | Warning signs, lighting, security guards       |
| **Preventive**        | Block unauthorized physical access                     | Fences, card readers, biometric scanners       |
| **Detective**         | Identify and record attempted breaches                 | CCTV, motion sensors, alarms                   |
| **Corrective**        | Respond to and recover from incidents                  | Fire extinguishers, backup power, disaster plans|
| **Compensating**      | Temporary or alternative control mechanisms            | Temporary badge policy, manual visitor logs    |

## 🔐 Authentication Methods for Physical Access

| Method                | Description                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Something you have** | Key card, badge, fob                |
| **Something you are**  | Biometrics (fingerprint, iris scan) |
| **Multi-factor**       | Badge + PIN, or card + fingerprint  |

## 🔥 Environmental Controls

| Control                | Function                                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **HVAC Systems**       | Maintain temperature and humidity                 |
| **Fire Suppression**   | Gas-based systems (e.g., FM-200), sprinklers       |
| **Power Management**   | UPS systems, backup generators                     |
| **Water & Humidity Detection** | Prevent flooding and corrosion             |
