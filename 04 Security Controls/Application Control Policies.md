**Application Control Policies** define which software applications are allowed or denied execution on a system or network. These policies help enforce security by restricting unauthorized, untrusted, or malicious applications from running, based on defined criteria.

They are a cornerstone of **endpoint hardening**, **least privilege**, and **malware prevention** strategies.

---

## üéØ Purpose of Application Control

- Prevent execution of **unauthorized or unknown software**
- Block **malware, ransomware, and fileless attacks**
- Enforce **compliance** with software usage policies
- Reduce attack surface and mitigate insider threats
- Control **legacy software** or unpatched applications

## üß∞ Core Enforcement Methods

| Method             | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Whitelisting**    | Only explicitly approved applications are allowed to run         |
| **Blacklisting**    | Known-bad applications are blocked                               |
| **Path Rules**      | Allow/block apps based on file path                              |
| **Hash Rules**      | Use cryptographic hash to identify allowed executables           |
| **Publisher Rules** | Allow only signed applications from specific vendors             |
| **File Attributes** | Block based on file name, size, or metadata                      |
| **App Reputation Services** | Cloud-based validation using threat intel and reputation scores |

| Platform        | Tool(s)                                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**      | AppLocker, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), SRP         |
| **macOS**        | Gatekeeper, MDM whitelisting                                        |
| **Linux**        | SELinux, AppArmor, auditd + custom scripts                          |
| **Enterprise**   | Third-party EPP/EDR solutions: Ivanti, Carbon Black, Symantec, CrowdStrike |

## üß† Use Cases

- **Deny unauthorized USB software** from running on secure hosts
- **Allow only signed corporate apps** in healthcare/finance environments
- **Prevent PowerShell or script interpreters** from executing unless explicitly allowed
- **Enforce application lists for remote workers** to reduce shadow IT risk

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Benefits of Application Control

- Blocks **zero-day malware** and **untrusted scripts**
- Stops **unauthorized changes** to system behavior
- Reduces dependence on signature-based antivirus
- Helps enforce **Zero Trust Architecture**
- Enhances visibility into app usage

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- **Initial tuning required** to avoid blocking legitimate software
- Risk of **operational disruption** if rules are too strict
- Ongoing **maintenance for updates and new software**
- Attackers may try **masquerading** as trusted apps or use **LOLBins**

## üß™ Best Practices

| Practice                   | Description                                                         |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start in Audit Mode**     | Monitor impacts before enforcing restrictions                      |
| **Use layered criteria**    | Combine hash, path, and publisher rules for stronger enforcement    |
| **Maintain application inventory** | Regularly review and update approved apps                   |
| **Restrict script engines** | Block or monitor `wscript`, `powershell`, `mshta`, etc.             |
| **Log and review violations** | Integrate with SIEM to detect unusual app execution attempts      |
