802.1X is an IEEE standard for **port-based Network Access Control (PNAC)**, often deployed alongside **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** and **Network Access Control (NAC)** systems. Together, they authenticate, authorize, and assess devices before granting network access ‚Äî especially important in Zero Trust and enterprise environments.

---

## üîê 802.1X Overview

- Acts as a **gatekeeper at the port level**, enforcing access policies.
- Used in both **wired (LAN)** and **wireless (WLAN)** networks.
- Typically deployed with a RADIUS server for backend authentication.
- Integral to **NAC** systems for endpoint posture evaluation.

### üîÅ Authentication Flow

1. **Supplicant** (client device) requests access.
2. **Authenticator** (e.g., switch/AP) forwards request to the **Authentication Server** (usually RADIUS) via EAP.
3. Server verifies credentials and returns decision.
4. Authenticator allows or blocks network access.

| Component           | Role                                               |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Supplicant          | Client device (e.g., laptop, phone)                |
| Authenticator       | Network device (e.g., switch, WAP)                 |
| Authentication Server | Validates identity (e.g., NPS, FreeRADIUS)       |

## üîÑ EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

EAP is a **flexible authentication framework** used within 802.1X to support various credential methods.

| EAP Method     | Description                                             | Secure? | Use Case                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| EAP-TLS        | Certificate-based, no passwords                         | ‚úÖ‚úÖ     | Enterprise Wi-Fi, VPNs          |
| PEAP           | Password-based inside TLS tunnel                        | ‚úÖ       | MSCHAPv2 + Active Directory      |
| EAP-TTLS       | Tunnel with username/password or legacy auth            | ‚úÖ       | Mixed environments              |
| EAP-FAST       | Cisco-specific, lightweight, PAC-based                  | ‚úÖ       | Cisco networks                   |
| EAP-MD5        | Password-only, no encryption                            | ‚ùå       | Insecure, deprecated             |
| LEAP           | Legacy Cisco, weak encryption                           | ‚ùå       | Deprecated                      |

## üõ† Network Access Control (NAC)

NAC **extends 802.1X** by applying policy decisions beyond identity ‚Äî such as device health and compliance status.

### üîç NAC Functions

| Function           | Purpose                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication     | Identity verification (certs, credentials)           |
| Posture Assessment | AV status, OS patch level, etc.                      |
| Authorization      | Role-based access (guest, contractor, employee)      |
| Remediation        | Redirect non-compliant devices to update zones       |
| Monitoring         | Ongoing session visibility and behavior tracking     |

### üß∞ Enforcement Models

| Model             | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 802.1X-based      | Layer 2 control using switch/AP                      |
| DHCP-based        | Assigns limited IPs to unknown devices               |
| Inline Gateway    | Traffic filtered via NAC appliance                   |
| Out-of-Band       | NAC device controls switch/AP indirectly             |

## ‚òÅ Cloud & Hybrid NAC

- Integrate NAC with **Azure AD**, **Okta**, or cloud-native identity systems.
- Use **cloud-delivered NAC** (e.g., Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass, Portnox).
- Apply NAC to remote endpoints via **ZTA** or **Software Defined Perimeter (SDP)**.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Prevents rogue device connections.
- Supports **per-user/device network policies**.
- Scales well for large enterprises.
- Complies with regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST).
- Integrates with **MFA**, **PKI**, and **SIEM logging**.
- Enables **BYOD** and **contractor** segmentation.

## ‚ö† Threats & Mitigations

| Threat                    | Mitigation Strategy                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Rogue device access       | 802.1X + NAC + posture validation                |
| Credential theft          | EAP-TLS + cert validation + MFA                 |
| MAC spoofing              | Pair with Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)          |
| Guest abuse               | VLAN isolation, role-based NAC segmentation      |
| Endpoint misconfiguration | MDM policies + server cert pinning              |

## üß† Best Practices

- Prefer **EAP-TLS** for strongest security.
- Use certs via **PKI**, **SCEP**, or **Intune**.
- Monitor login failures (possible brute-force or rogue devices).

- Retain **RADIUS logs** and integrate with **SIEM**.
- Continuously assess endpoint compliance posture.
