In cybersecurity and governance, specific roles are assigned to ensure **data is managed securely, accurately, and in compliance** with policies and regulations. These roles define who is accountable, who handles day-to-day operations, and who accesses or processes data.

---

## üéØ Why It Matters

- Ensures **clear accountability** for data security and compliance
- Enables **effective implementation of access control**
- Aligns with **security frameworks** (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR)
- Reduces risk of **unauthorized access**, **data loss**, and **breach liability**

## üîê Security Implications

- Roles define **who has access to what data** and **under what conditions**
- Helps apply **least privilege** and **separation of duties**
- Supports **compliance audits** and **data classification schemes**

---

## üß† Example: Access Control Enforcement

> The **Data Owner** classifies customer records as *Confidential*, requiring **MFA** and **encryption-at-rest**. The **Data Custodian** implements these controls, and the **Security Officer** audits access logs quarterly.
