## üéØ Goals of Phishing Defense

- Detect and block phishing emails or messages
- Prevent credential theft and malware delivery
- Educate users to recognize and report phishing attempts
- Ensure fast response and recovery from successful attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Defense Strategies

### üß∞ 1. **Email Security Tools**

| Tool / Technique           | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Email Security Gateway (SEG)** | Filters phishing, spam, and malicious attachments     |
| **SPF, DKIM, DMARC**       | Validates sender authenticity and blocks spoofed domains |
| **URL Rewriting / Sandboxing** | Analyzes links and attachments before delivery         |
| **Block Lists & Threat Feeds** | Stops known malicious senders and domains              |

---

### üß† 2. **User Awareness Training**

- Regular simulated phishing campaigns
- Teach users to:
  - Hover over links before clicking
  - Avoid opening unexpected attachments
  - Spot domain typos and suspicious sender info
  - Report phishing via email buttons or helpdesk

---

### üîê 3. **Authentication Controls**

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Stops attackers even if credentials are stolen
- **SSO with strong ID providers**: Helps reduce password entry points
- Enforce password reuse detection and breach monitoring

---

### üßæ 4. **Policy & Process Enforcement**

- Enforce **email encryption** for sensitive content
- Block **macro-enabled attachments** by default
- Use **data loss prevention (DLP)** to block leaks via email
- Create **incident response playbooks** for phishing

---

### üîç 5. **Detection and Response**

| Control                 | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SIEM Monitoring**      | Alerts on login anomalies, geo-based risk, click rates       |
| **User-Reported Alerts** | Enable users to report phishing via Outlook / GSuite buttons |
| **Incident Response (IR)** | Isolate infected systems, reset credentials, blacklist domains |
| **Threat Intelligence**  | Share IOCs to improve proactive defense                      |

---

## üö® What To Do If Phished

1. **Disconnect** compromised system from network
2. **Reset credentials** immediately
3. **Notify** security or helpdesk team
4. **Scan** endpoints for malware (attachments, keyloggers)
5. **Investigate** extent of impact and log details

---

## üß† Red Flags for Users

- Urgent tone ("Your account will be disabled!")
- Spoofed display names and URLs
- Requests for credentials, money, or sensitive data
- Unusual grammar or typos in professional emails
