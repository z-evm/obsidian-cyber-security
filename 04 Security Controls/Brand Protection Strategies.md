## 🛡 Defensive Strategies

### 🌐 Domain Defense

- Register domain variations (typosquats, other TLDs)
- Monitor WHOIS + DNS changes for brand-like domains
- Use **certificate transparency logs** (e.g., `crt.sh`) to find certs issued for brand-like domains

### 📱 Social Media Monitoring

- Detect fake accounts using:
  - Brand keyword search
  - Verified account impersonation flags
- Report directly to platforms for takedown

### 📦 App Store Monitoring

- Monitor Google Play, Apple App Store, APKMirror
- Detect unofficial apps using logos or brand names
- Use tools like AppDetex or third-party takedown services

### 🧠 Customer Awareness

- Publish official domain/contact info
- Educate customers on phishing and impersonation
- Provide reporting channels for suspicious activity

## 📋 Incident Response

- Validate impersonation attempt
- Capture evidence (screenshots, DNS records)
- Submit takedown requests to:
  - Domain registrars
  - Social platforms
  - Hosting providers
- Notify legal or marketing/comms teams
- Document indicators in threat intel systems

---

## 📜 Legal Considerations

- Register trademarks and logos for legal takedown leverage
- Work with intellectual property attorneys if needed
