Sandboxing is a **technical security control** that isolates processes, applications, or code in a controlled environment to observe behavior, prevent malicious impact, and contain threats.

---

## üéØ What Is Sandboxing?

- A **preventive** and **detective** control method.
- Runs code in a *restricted, virtualized, or containerized environment* to:
  - Observe behavior
  - Detect malicious activity
  - Prevent harm to the host system

## üß± Sandboxing as a Security Control

| Category         | Control Type    | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technical**     | Preventive       | Isolates untrusted code/applications from system resources                  |
|                  | Detective        | Observes system calls, behavior anomalies during runtime                     |
| **Operational**   | Preventive       | Used in malware analysis labs or dynamic testing environments                |

## üîê Common Sandboxing Use Cases

| Use Case                  | Description                                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Malware Analysis**       | Runs unknown files in an isolated lab environment                       |
| **Browser Sandboxing**     | Modern browsers isolate tabs to prevent cross-site compromise           |
| **Email Attachments**      | Detonates files in a sandbox before delivering to end users             |
| **Application Testing**    | Developers test new or untrusted code without impacting production      |
| **Mobile OS Sandboxing**   | Android/iOS restrict app access to OS and other apps                    |
