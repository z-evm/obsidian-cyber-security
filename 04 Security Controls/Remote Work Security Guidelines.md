**Remote Work Security Guidelines** define the policies and best practices that protect organizational assets, systems, and data when accessed outside traditional office environments. As remote and hybrid work models grow, these controls are critical for maintaining a **secure and compliant** infrastructure.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Protect against **data leakage**, **malware**, and **unauthorized access**
- Enforce **secure connectivity** and **device hygiene**
- Align with policies like [[Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)]] and [[Data Loss Prevention (DLP)]]
- Maintain **compliance** with regulations such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR

---

## üß± Key Security Areas

### üîê Authentication & Access

- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Require **strong passwords** and rotation policies
- Implement **Single Sign-On (SSO)** where possible
- Restrict access using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

### üåê Network & Connectivity

- Require use of **corporate VPN** with split tunneling disabled
- Enforce **encrypted connections** (TLS, IPsec)
- Block access from **untrusted public Wi-Fi** without VPN
- Monitor endpoints with **NAC** or posture checks

### üíª Endpoint Security

- Use **company-managed devices** where possible
- Enforce **endpoint protection** (AV, EDR, host firewall)
- Enable **auto-lock, disk encryption**, and device tracking
- Block **USB drives** and external device usage unless authorized

### üìÅ Data Protection

- Enable **full-disk encryption** (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault)
- Restrict data downloads to **local devices**
- Use **cloud collaboration tools** instead of emailing attachments
- Monitor file transfers with **DLP policies**

### üßæ User Behavior & Awareness

- Require completion of **security awareness training**
- Prohibit printing or storing sensitive data on personal devices
- Report lost/stolen devices **immediately**
- Use **privacy screens** in public or shared spaces

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing & Credential Theft** | MFA, user training, phishing simulations      |
| **Device Theft**            | Disk encryption, remote wipe capabilities        |
| **Public Wi-Fi Snooping**   | Always-on VPN, DNS filtering                     |
| **Shadow IT / SaaS Usage**  | Web filtering, CASB, SaaS discovery tools        |
