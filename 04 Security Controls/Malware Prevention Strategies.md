**Malware prevention strategies** are proactive and reactive controls designed to stop, detect, and mitigate malicious software (malware) before it can compromise systems, data, or users. These strategies form a key component of a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity.

## 🎯 Goals of Malware Prevention

- **Prevent infection** from known and unknown malware
- **Detect and isolate** malicious behavior before damage occurs
- **Reduce attack surface** by limiting vectors and privileges
- **Ensure resilience** through backups, patching, and recovery planning

## 🧰 Key Prevention Layers

| Layer              | Description                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Layer**      | Awareness training, phishing resistance, least privilege enforcement |
| **Endpoint Layer**  | EDR, antivirus, host firewalls, application control                |
| **Network Layer**   | IDS/IPS, firewalls, DNS filtering, segmentation                    |
| **Application Layer**| Patch management, secure development, input validation            |
| **Data Layer**      | Encryption, access control, DLP tools                              |
| **Cloud/SaaS Layer**| CASB, SSO policies, secure API usage                               |

## 🧩 Technical Strategies

### ✅ 1. Signature-Based Detection
- Traditional AV engines use known malware fingerprints
- Effective for **known threats**, but poor against zero-days

### 🧠 2. Behavioral & Heuristic Analysis
- Flags suspicious actions (e.g., privilege escalation, unusual I/O)
- Used in **EDR**, **sandboxing**, and **SIEM correlation**

### 📦 3. Application Control / Whitelisting
- Only approved apps can run
- Prevents **unauthorized executables, scripts, and LOLBins**

### 🔒 4. Patch Management
- Fixes known vulnerabilities exploited by malware
- Essential for OS, applications, drivers, and firmware

### 👨‍🏫 5. Security Awareness Training
- Teaches users to identify phishing, social engineering, and rogue attachments
- Reduces the **human attack surface**

### 🧼 6. Network Segmentation
- Limits malware propagation (e.g., ransomware lateral movement)
- Use VLANs, subnets, and internal firewalls

### ☁️ 7. Email & Web Filtering
- Blocks malicious attachments, links, macros, and drive-by downloads
- Can be implemented via **secure email gateways** and **DNS filtering**

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sandboxing**              | Executes files in isolated VM to detect malicious behavior |
| **Threat Intelligence Feeds** | Blocks known IOCs/IPs/domains associated with malware    |
| **PowerShell Constrained Language Mode** | Prevents script-based attacks              |
| **Secure Boot & TPM**       | Prevents rootkits and bootkits from executing              |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Enforces continuous verification across all resources      |

## 🔍 Detection & Response Integration

- SIEM tools to **correlate anomalies**
- EDR solutions for **real-time behavioral analytics**
- SOAR platforms for **automated containment and remediation**

---

## 🛡️ Recovery Considerations

- Maintain **air-gapped, immutable backups**
- Use **incident response playbooks** to contain outbreaks
- Test **business continuity plans** regularly
