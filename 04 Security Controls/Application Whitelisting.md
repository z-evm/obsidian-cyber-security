**Application Whitelisting** is a security strategy that allows only pre-approved (whitelisted) applications to run on a system, while all others are blocked by default. This **"default deny"** approach significantly reduces the risk of executing unauthorized or malicious software.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Prevent execution of **unauthorized**, **unknown**, or **malicious** programs
- Protect against **malware**, **zero-day exploits**, and **fileless attacks**
- Enforce strict **control over software installations and execution**
- Support regulatory frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, PCI-DSS)

## üß∞ How It Works

| Component              | Description                                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Whitelist Database** | Contains cryptographic hashes, path rules, or publisher certificates    |
| **Policy Engine**      | Enforces rules based on app identity, user roles, file location         |
| **Execution Interception** | OS intercepts execution and checks it against the whitelist          |
| **Monitoring Tools**   | Log attempts to execute non-whitelisted apps                            |

---

## üß† Whitelisting Criteria

- **File path** (e.g., `C:\Program Files\trusted.exe`)
- **Cryptographic hash** (unique fingerprint of the file)
- **Digital signature** (trusted publisher certificate)
- **Parent process/command line arguments**
- **File size or version metadata**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

| Benefit                      | Description                                                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Malware Prevention**       | Blocks untrusted or unknown executables by default            |
| **Ransomware Defense**       | Stops execution of malicious encryption tools                 |
| **Fileless Attack Mitigation** | Prevents script interpreters (e.g., `powershell.exe`) from unauthorized use |
| **System Hardening**         | Enforces control in high-integrity systems                    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Tools & Methods

| Platform/Tool              | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows AppLocker**      | Built-in tool for defining rules via GPO                      |
| **Windows Defender App Control (WDAC)** | Stronger enforcement using kernel-mode policies  |
| **Software Restriction Policies (SRP)** | Legacy method, less granular                     |
| **Third-party Tools**      | Carbon Black, Symantec, Ivanti, McAfee Application Control    |
| **Linux Tools**            | SELinux, AppArmor, auditd (for control + monitoring)          |

## üìâ Challenges

- **Initial policy tuning** may be time-consuming
- Can **disrupt business operations** if legitimate tools are blocked
- Requires **continuous maintenance** to handle updates and new apps
- Attackers may try to **masquerade** as approved apps (signed malware)

---

## üß™ Best Practices

- Start in **audit/log-only** mode before enforcement
- Use **publisher certificates** and **hash-based rules** for critical binaries
- Whitelist **only what is necessary** (principle of least privilege)
- Regularly **review and update** whitelists
- Combine with **application inventory and patch management**
