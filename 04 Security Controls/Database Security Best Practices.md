Databases store critical data such as PII, credentials, and financial records. **Database security** involves protecting the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data against unauthorized access, abuse, and compromise.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Database Security

- 🔐 Protect sensitive and regulated data
- 🧱 Enforce access control and authentication
- 🛡️ Prevent data breaches, injection attacks, and privilege abuse
- 📜 Meet compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

---

## 🧱 Best Practices Overview

### 🔒 1. Access Control & Authentication

- ✅ Use **principle of least privilege (PoLP)** for all database users
- 🔐 Implement **strong, multi-factor authentication** for admins
- 📦 Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to segregate duties
- 🗂 Create separate accounts for app access, DBAs, and reporting

---

### 🔍 2. Encryption

| Type                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Data in Transit**  | Use TLS/SSL between client and DB server |
| **Data at Rest**     | Encrypt full database or specific columns (e.g., AES-256) |
| **Backups**          | Ensure encrypted backup files and secure key storage |

---

### 🧪 3. Input Validation & Injection Prevention

- ✅ Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**
- 🔍 Sanitize all user inputs before using them in queries
- 🛠 Regularly test for **SQL Injection** and **NoSQL Injection**

---

### 🔄 4. Patching and Updates

- 📅 Regularly apply **security patches and updates**
- 🔁 Subscribe to **vendor advisories** (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- 🧪 Test patches in staging before production deployment

---

### 🧰 5. Auditing & Monitoring

- 📜 Enable **audit logs** for connections, query execution, and privilege changes
- 🕵️ Use SIEM tools to correlate logs and detect suspicious behavior
- 🔔 Alert on failed login attempts, unusual queries, or privilege escalations

---

### 📊 6. Database Hardening

- 🧹 Remove **unused accounts, roles, schemas, and stored procedures**
- 🚫 Disable or uninstall default database features you don’t use
- 🔐 Change default ports and credentials immediately
- 📁 Secure the database configuration files (e.g., `my.cnf`, `postgresql.conf`)

---

### 📦 7. Backup & Recovery

- 💾 Implement secure, automated backup procedures
- 🔐 Encrypt and store backups offsite or in secure cloud storage
- 🧪 Test recovery plans regularly to ensure restore integrity

---

## 🧠 Additional Tips

- 🌐 Restrict external access using firewalls, VPCs, and IP whitelisting
- 🧱 Isolate databases from public-facing applications
- 🧪 Perform regular **vulnerability scans** and **penetration testing**
- 🔁 Review user permissions and access logs periodically

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

| Tool              | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **HashiCorp Vault** | Secret and key management |
| **Auditd / syslog** | OS-level logging for DB activity |
| **SQLmap**         | Injection testing tool |
| **pgAudit / MySQL Enterprise Audit** | Built-in auditing |
| **AWS RDS IAM / Azure Managed Identity** | Cloud-native access control |

---

## 📚 Compliance Considerations

- 📜 **GDPR**: Secure data storage and subject access rights
- 💳 **PCI DSS**: Encrypt cardholder data and access logs
- 🏥 **HIPAA**: Enforce privacy, auditing, and breach notification
