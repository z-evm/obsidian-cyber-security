**Access Control Provisioning** refers to the **process of granting, modifying, auditing, and revoking access rights** to users, systems, or services based on defined security policies and business requirements.

Effective provisioning ensures that users have **appropriate access** ‚Äî no more, no less ‚Äî and that access is maintained **securely and efficiently** throughout the user lifecycle.

## üéØ Purpose

> **Access Control Provisioning answers the question:**  
> _"How do we manage who gets access, when, and to what?"_

Goals:
- Enforce **least privilege** and **need-to-know**
- Ensure **timely and accurate** access for users
- Support **compliance** with audit and regulatory requirements
- Minimize **insider threats**, orphaned accounts, and privilege creep

## üß± Provisioning Lifecycle Phases

| Phase              | Description                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Request**         | Access request initiated by user, manager, or automated trigger |
| **Approval**        | Role owner or system admin authorizes the request        |
| **Provisioning**    | Access is granted via IAM tools, scripts, or manual steps|
| **Validation**      | Confirm correct access level and functionality            |
| **Review**          | Periodic access reviews for compliance                   |
| **Deprovisioning**  | Revoke access when user leaves or no longer requires it  |

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

| Tool/Technology         | Function                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **IAM Platforms**        | Manage identities and enforce access policies    |
| **Directory Services**   | Centralize user authentication (e.g., AD, LDAP) |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Assign access by job function       |
| **Access Request Systems**| Automate approvals and workflows               |
| **Audit Logs & SIEM**    | Track and alert on access changes               |

## üîê Provisioning Models

| Model             | Description                                       | Example                                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Manual Provisioning** | Admin manually assigns access rights         | IT creates a new email account by request      |
| **Automated Provisioning** | IAM tools provision based on role, group | User added to HR group gets payroll access     |
| **Just-In-Time (JIT)**   | Temporary access granted on-demand          | Admin gets 2-hour access to production server  |
| **Self-Service with Approval** | User requests access; requires approval | Request via service portal                     |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **RBAC or ABAC** for scalable access management
- Apply **least privilege** by default
- Automate provisioning and deprovisioning via IAM systems
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- Conduct **regular access reviews and certifications**
- Log and monitor **all access changes and escalations**
- Maintain clear **ownership and approval chains**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Risks

- **Orphaned accounts** (no longer active but still valid)
- **Privilege creep** from role changes over time
- **Excessive access** granted without true need
- **Manual errors** during provisioning or deprovisioning
- **Insufficient logging** for access audits
