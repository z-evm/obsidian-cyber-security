# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Knowledge Vault

Welcome to your **Cybersecurity Knowledge Vault** — a comprehensive, structured, and curated Obsidian repository designed to support your journey toward the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, and beyond.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This vault serves as a **central hub** for all security-related knowledge, organized for easy reference, study, and operational use. It consolidates materials from trusted sources including **Dr. Messer’s Security+ series**, NIST, ISO, CIS, and other industry frameworks.

---

## 🔍 Structure

The vault is organized into modular, interlinked notes covering:

- 🔐 **Security Controls** — technical, physical, administrative
- 🧩 **Access Control Models** — RBAC, ABAC, DAC, MAC
- 🛠️ **System Hardening** — CIS Benchmarks, secure baselines
- 🧪 **Security Assessment & Testing** — vulnerability scanning, pen testing
- 🎯 **Risk Management** — qualitative & quantitative assessments
- 📄 **Policy & Compliance** — ISO 27001, NIST RMF, PCI-DSS
- 🌐 **Network Security** — protocols, TLS, firewall zones
- 📦 **Software Security** — secure coding, SDLC, OWASP Top 10
- 📊 **Monitoring & Logging** — SIEM, auditing, alerting
- 🧠 **Threat Intelligence** — indicators, threat actors, frameworks
- 🔄 **Incident Response** — IR plans, forensics, chain of custody
- 🧰 **Tools & Cheat Sheets** — BloodHound, Metasploit, Volatility

Each note uses Obsidian-friendly syntax and internal links like `[[Access Control Models]]` to allow seamless navigation.

## 🧱 Sample Entry: Security Controls

See `[[Security Controls]]` for a breakdown of:

- Control **types**: Preventive, Detective, Corrective, etc.
- Control **implementations**: Technical, Operational, Managerial
- Real-world applications
- Tagging and linking conventions
- To-do structure for note expansion

## 🧭 Tags & Navigation

Use these core tags to guide your studies:

#security_controls #access_control #risk_assessment #compliance #SIEM #incident_response #encryption #vulnerability_management #devsecops #SOC

## 🧠 Study Flow

Suggested usage approach:

1. **Start with fundamentals**: `[[CIA Triad]]`, `[[Control Types]]`, `[[Access Models]]`
2. **Follow Dr. Messer’s Security+ series**: Use timestamps and map to vault content
3. **Deepen understanding** with mappings to standards (NIST, CIS, ISO)
4. **Simulate scenarios**: Apply control logic, defense-in-depth, or response flows
5. **Reinforce learning** with practice labs and notes from Red Team/Blue Team tools

## ✍️ Contribution Style

All notes follow a consistent structure:

- `## 🔍 Overview`
- `## 📊 Tables or Breakdowns`
- `## 🛠 Application`
- `## 🧭 Tags & Links`
- `## ✅ To Do`

Use this template when adding new content.
