**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** establishes national standards in the U.S. for protecting **Protected Health Information (PHI)**. Organizations that handle PHI‚Äîcalled **covered entities** and **business associates**‚Äîmust comply with HIPAA‚Äôs **Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules**.

This checklist provides a structured approach to achieve and maintain HIPAA compliance.

## üîê HIPAA Security Rule Compliance

Covers **electronic PHI (ePHI)** and mandates three types of safeguards:

### üß± 1. Administrative Safeguards

- [ ] Perform **risk assessment** for ePHI exposure
- [ ] Assign a **security officer** and define roles/responsibilities
- [ ] Develop **security policies and procedures**
- [ ] Implement **workforce training** and ongoing awareness
- [ ] Establish a **contingency plan** (data backup, disaster recovery)
- [ ] Apply **access controls** based on job roles (RBAC)
- [ ] Conduct **periodic evaluations** and updates

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Physical Safeguards

- [ ] Control **facility access** (badge systems, locks, surveillance)
- [ ] Secure **workstations** to limit ePHI exposure
- [ ] Define **policies for hardware movement/disposal**
- [ ] Secure **portable devices** (laptops, USBs, mobile)

### üßÆ 3. Technical Safeguards

- [ ] Implement **encryption** for data in transit and at rest
- [ ] Use **unique user IDs** and **strong authentication**
- [ ] Configure **automatic logoff** for idle systems
- [ ] Enable **audit controls** and maintain access logs
- [ ] Use **integrity controls** to detect unauthorized data changes

## üîè HIPAA Privacy Rule Compliance

Protects all **forms of PHI**, not just electronic:

- [ ] Limit PHI access to **minimum necessary**

Outlines actions after a **PHI breach**:

- [ ] Assess and document **breach risk and impact**
- [ ] Notify **affected individuals** within 60 days
- [ ] Notify **HHS** (Health & Human Services)
  - [ ] < 500 individuals = Annual report
  - [ ] ‚â• 500 individuals = Immediate notification
- [ ] Notify **media** if breach affects ‚â• 500 in a region
- [ ] Maintain **incident logs and response procedures**

---

## üß∞ Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Maintain all **policies and procedures** (minimum 6 years)
