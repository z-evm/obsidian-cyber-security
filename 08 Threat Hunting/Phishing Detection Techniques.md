## üéØ Purpose

> **Phishing Detection answers the question:**  
> _"Is this email or communication an attempt to deceive or exploit a user?"_

Goals:
- Detect and prevent **credential theft**, **malware delivery**, or **fraudulent activity**
- Protect users from **social engineering** attacks
- Enable **automated and user-assisted detection**
- Support **incident response** and **user training**
