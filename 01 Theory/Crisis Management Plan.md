A **Crisis Management Plan (CMP)** outlines the structured approach an organization takes to respond to high-impact, disruptive incidents that threaten operations, reputation, or public safety. It ensures a timely, coordinated, and effective response to crises.

## üéØ Purpose

- Mitigate the **impact of crises** on people, processes, and property.
- Maintain **leadership control** during rapidly evolving events.
- Protect brand reputation, stakeholder trust, and legal standing.
- Restore normalcy and **reassure internal/external audiences**.

## üß± Key Components of a CMP

| Component                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Crisis Definition**         | Criteria for what qualifies as a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù (vs. incident or emergency).       |
| **Crisis Management Team (CMT)** | Core group responsible for command, decision-making, and communication.     |
| **Roles and Responsibilities** | Defined leadership roles (e.g., Incident Commander, Spokesperson, Liaison). |
| **Activation Protocols**      | How and when the CMP is activated; criteria and authority thresholds.        |
| **Communication Strategy**    | Integration with [[Emergency Communications Plan]] for internal and external messaging. |
| **Scenario Playbooks**        | Pre-developed action plans for common crisis types (e.g., cyberattack, flood, PR scandal). |
| **Resource Directory**        | Key contacts, vendors, facilities, and tools needed in a crisis.            |
| **Training and Exercises**    | Regular drills, simulations, and after-action reviews (AARs).               |
| **Recovery and Transition**   | Plan for returning to normal operations or invoking BCP/DRP plans.          |

## üîÅ Crisis Management Lifecycle

1. **Prepare**
   - Identify potential crisis scenarios.
   - Build response playbooks and assemble CMT.

2. **Detect and Assess**
   - Recognize early warning signs.
   - Classify the event severity and potential impact.

3. **Respond**
   - Activate the CMP.
   - Engage communication channels and incident response teams.

4. **Recover**
   - Transition to BCP/DRP if necessary.
   - Resume operations and stabilize the environment.

5. **Review and Improve**
   - Conduct After Action Review (AAR).
   - Update CMP and related policies.

## üõ° Common Crisis Scenarios

- Major cyber incident or data breach  
- Natural disasters (earthquake, flood, bushfire)  
- Pandemic or public health emergency  
- Executive misconduct or PR crisis  
- Infrastructure failure or prolonged outage  
- Acts of violence or terrorism

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Integrate CMP with **IRP**, **BCP**, and **COOP**.
- Use a **centralized crisis command center** (virtual or physical).
- Assign **alternates** for each critical role in the CMT.
- Run **tabletop exercises** annually.
- Store copies of CMP in **redundant secure locations**.
