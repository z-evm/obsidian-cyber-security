**Isolation and containment** are critical phases in incident response used to prevent further damage by restricting an attacker's access and halting lateral movement within a compromised environment.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Stop active threats** from spreading
- **Minimize data loss or corruption**
- **Preserve forensic evidence**
- **Enable secure analysis or recovery**
- **Protect unaffected systems**

---

## üö® When to Apply

- During **malware outbreaks** (e.g. ransomware, worms)
- After **unauthorized access detection**
- In **zero-day exploitation** scenarios
- Upon **anomalous traffic** or **C2 communications** being identified
- When **policy violations** or insider threats are suspected

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Techniques

| Method                     | Description                                                   | Tools / Methods                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Network Isolation**      | Disconnect system from the network to stop C2 & lateral move  | VLAN segmentation, firewall rules         |
| **Endpoint Containment**   | Quarantine endpoint or terminate sessions                     | EDR/XDR quarantine, disabling accounts    |
| **Application Isolation**  | Limit malicious code to sandboxed container                   | Sandboxing, containerization (Docker)     |
| **Virtual Machine Rollback** | Revert infected VM to known good snapshot                   | Hypervisor snapshot tools                 |
| **Logical Access Controls**| Remove access to shared resources                             | ACLs, GPO restrictions                    |
| **Process Suspension**     | Temporarily halt suspicious services or executables           | Task Manager, `kill`, `ps`, `systemctl`   |

## üîÑ Isolation vs Containment

| Term           | Focus                      | Goal                              |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Isolation**   | Disconnecting systems       | Prevent communication/spread      |
| **Containment** | Restricting threat vectors  | Limit scope & control incident    |

## üß∞ Tools Commonly Used

- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender
- **Firewalls / NAC**: Palo Alto, Cisco ISE, pfSense
- **Hypervisors**: VMware, Hyper-V, VirtualBox
- **SOAR Platforms**: Cortex XSOAR, Splunk SOAR
- **Command-line tools**:
  - `iptables`, `netstat`, `ufw` for Linux
  - `netsh`, `taskkill`, `schtasks` for Windows

---

## üß† Example Use Case

> An organization detects unusual lateral movement from an internal workstation. Using EDR, the security team **isolates the machine from the network** and **contains the threat** by revoking user credentials, disabling SMB access, and deploying a YARA scan across similar hosts.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Forensics Considerations

- **Avoid full shutdown** unless absolutely necessary.
- Use **logical isolation** (e.g. port disable, VLAN shift) to **preserve RAM & disk state**.
- Document all containment steps for chain of custody.
