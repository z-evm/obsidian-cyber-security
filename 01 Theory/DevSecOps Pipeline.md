**DevSecOps** integrates **security** into every phase of the **DevOps lifecycle**, shifting security "left" into development and automating controls throughout CI/CD. The goal is to build secure, compliant, and resilient applications without slowing down deployment velocity.

> 🧠 *Security is everyone's responsibility—from developers to operators.*

## 🧱 DevSecOps Core Principles

- **Shift Left**: Identify vulnerabilities early in the SDLC.
- **Automate Everything**: Testing, scanning, enforcement.
- **Security as Code**: Policies and controls defined declaratively.
- **Collaboration**: Dev, Sec, and Ops teams work together.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Real-time security alerts into developer workflows.

## 📦 DevSecOps Pipeline Stages

| Phase            | Security Focus Area                                      | Tools / Actions                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Plan**         | Threat modeling, compliance requirements                 | STRIDE, OWASP Threat Dragon               |
| **Develop**      | Secure coding, secrets management                        | ESLint, git-secrets, Talisman             |
| **Build**        | Static code analysis (SAST), dependency scanning         | SonarQube, Semgrep, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check |
| **Test**         | Dynamic and interactive testing                          | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, DAST, IAST         |
| **Release**      | Artifact signing, compliance checks                      | Notary, Sigstore, Open Policy Agent (OPA) |
| **Deploy**       | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning, runtime controls  | tfsec, Checkov, KICS, Aqua, Sysdig        |
| **Operate**      | Runtime monitoring, anomaly detection, log analysis      | Falco, Prometheus, SIEM, CloudTrail       |
| **Monitor**      | Threat intel, incident response, continuous feedback     | Wazuh, ELK Stack, SOAR platforms          |

## 🔐 DevSecOps Key Practices

### 🧬 1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- Scan source code during the build process.
- Finds hardcoded secrets, unsafe patterns, logic flaws.

### 🌐 2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
- Scan live apps in staging or pre-prod.
- Detects XSS, SQLi, SSRF, auth issues.

### ⚙ 3. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- Detect vulnerable third-party libraries.
- Check for license risks and outdated dependencies.

### 🧱 4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**
- Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes YAMLs for misconfigurations.
- Tools: tfsec, Terrascan, KICS, Checkov.

### 🔒 5. **Secrets Management**
- Detect and prevent hardcoded secrets in repositories.
- Tools: git-secrets, Gitleaks, Vault, Doppler.

### 📜 6. **Policy as Code**
- Enforce compliance and security rules via code.
- Tools: Open Policy Agent (OPA), Rego, Kyverno.

## 🚨 Continuous Compliance and Audit

- Enforce CIS Benchmarks, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001 in CI/CD.
- Generate evidence for compliance audits automatically.
- Integrate into Jira/Ticketing systems for remediation tracking.
