The **Chain of Custody** is a formal process used to maintain and document the integrity of evidence from the point of collection through presentation in a legal or investigative context. It's essential in **digital forensics**, **incident response**, and **legal proceedings**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🧾 **Preserve Evidence Integrity**  
- 🔍 **Ensure Accountability**  
- ⚖️ **Support Legal Admissibility**  
- 🔒 **Prevent Tampering or Contamination**

> If the chain is broken, the evidence may be considered inadmissible in court.

## 🧱 Key Elements

| Element                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Identification**        | Labeling and describing the evidence clearly. |
| **Collection**            | Proper acquisition using forensically sound methods. |
| **Documentation**         | Detailed log of who handled the evidence and when. |
| **Storage**               | Secure, access-controlled location to prevent tampering. |
| **Transfer**              | Each handoff must be documented with time, date, handler, and purpose. |
| **Verification**          | Validating evidence has not been altered at each stage. |

## 📋 Chain of Custody Log Example

| Time        | Handler       | Action         | Description          |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 10:23 AM    | Jane Doe       | Collected      | Laptop from HR Office |
| 11:15 AM    | John Smith     | Transferred    | Transport to lab      |
| 01:00 PM    | Analyst Team   | Analysis Start | Imaging begins        |

> Each entry should be signed or digitally authenticated when possible.

## ⚠️ Risks of Improper Handling

- 🚫 **Evidence inadmissibility in court**
- 🔄 **Loss of evidence integrity**
- 🕳️ **Data tampering claims**
- 🔍 **Hindrance to investigation**

---

## 🛡 Best Practices

- 📷 **Photograph evidence at the time of discovery**
- 📝 **Use tamper-evident packaging and seals**
- ✅ **Document every step and handler**
- 🔐 **Secure digital evidence with hashing (e.g., SHA-256)**
- 🧪 **Use write blockers when imaging drives**
- 📦 **Label evidence clearly with unique IDs**

## 🧪 Chain of Custody in Digital Forensics

| Step             | Tools/Techniques Used |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Disk imaging     | `dd`, FTK Imager, EnCase |
| Hash validation  | `md5sum`, `sha256sum` |
| Evidence tracking| Case management systems |
| Isolation        | Faraday bags, secure vaults |
