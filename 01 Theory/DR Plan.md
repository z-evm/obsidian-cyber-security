A **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** is a formal document that outlines an organization‚Äôs process for restoring **IT systems, data, and infrastructure** after a disruptive event (natural disaster, cyberattack, power outage, etc.). It is an essential part of overall **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Restore **mission-critical IT services** as quickly as possible.
- Minimize **downtime, data loss**, and operational disruption.
- Define roles, responsibilities, and **technical recovery procedures**.
- Support compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.

## üîÅ DRP Lifecycle

| Phase            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Risk Assessment** | Identify threats to IT operations (natural, human, technical).           |
| **2. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** | Determine impact of system/service downtime.                     |
| **3. Strategy Development** | Select recovery strategies based on RTO/RPO.                            |
| **4. Plan Development** | Document procedures, responsibilities, resources.                        |
| **5. Testing and Training** | Regularly simulate DR events and train response teams.              |
| **6. Maintenance and Review** | Update plan based on audits, system changes, and post-incident reviews.|

## üß± Core Components of a DRP

| Component                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recovery Objectives**       | Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).   |
| **Critical Systems & Data**   | Prioritized list of applications, services, servers, and storage.          |
| **Disaster Scenarios**        | Types of disasters the plan addresses (e.g., cyberattack, fire, flood).    |
| **Backup & Replication Plan** | Procedures for data backup, replication frequency, and storage location.   |
| **Recovery Procedures**       | Step-by-step restoration instructions for each critical system.            |
| **Roles and Responsibilities**| IT, security, legal, communications, external vendors.                    |
| **Alternative Facilities**    | Cold/Warm/Hot sites, cloud failover mechanisms.                            |
| **Communication Plan**        | Aligned with the [[Emergency Communications Plan]].                        |
| **Escalation Path**           | Chain of command during incident response and recovery.                    |

## ‚è± Recovery Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **RTO** *(Recovery Time Objective)* | Maximum acceptable downtime for a system or service. |
| **RPO** *(Recovery Point Objective)* | Maximum tolerable amount of data loss, measured in time. |
| **MTPD** *(Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption)* | Longest period a system can be down before causing irreversible harm. |

## üîß DR Tools & Solutions

- **Backup & Restore**: Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik, AWS Backup  
- **Cloud Failover**: AWS Route 53, Azure Site Recovery, GCP DR  
- **Virtualization**: VM snapshots, VDI, container-based recovery  
- **Orchestration**: Runbooks, scripts, Terraform, Ansible  
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Nagios, ELK stack  

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Store DRP both **on-premises and offsite** (or in the cloud).
- Conduct **quarterly testing**: tabletop, functional, full failover.
- Define **clear roles and alternates**.
- Align DRP with business priorities from the [[Business Impact Analysis (BIA)]].
- Integrate DR testing into change management and audit cycles.
