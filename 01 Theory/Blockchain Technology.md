## üìå Core Characteristics

| Feature          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decentralized**| No single point of control; maintained by distributed nodes                 |
| **Immutable**    | Transactions cannot be altered once validated and added to the ledger       |
| **Transparent**  | Transactions are visible to all participants (in public blockchains)        |
| **Consensus-Based** | Validations are performed via algorithms like PoW, PoS, or PBFT          |
| **Cryptographically Secure** | Uses hashing and digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity |

## üèó Blockchain Structure

1. **Block**:
   - Contains a list of transactions
   - Includes metadata (timestamp, nonce, previous hash, etc.)
   - Linked to previous block via hash (forming a chain)

2. **Chain**:
   - A sequential set of blocks
   - Validated using a consensus algorithm
   - The longer the chain, the harder it is to tamper with historical data

3. **Node**:
   - A device that maintains a copy of the blockchain
   - Can be full nodes (store entire blockchain) or light nodes (partial storage)

## üîê Security Features

| Security Aspect        | How Blockchain Addresses It                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**    | Optional, via private/permissioned chains or encryption           |
| **Integrity**          | Achieved via hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) and consensus rules   |
| **Availability**       | High fault tolerance due to decentralized architecture            |
| **Authentication**     | Public-key cryptography for user identity and signature validation |
| **Non-Repudiation**    | Transactions are digitally signed and recorded immutably          |

## üß† Types of Blockchain

| Type               | Description                                           | Use Case Examples               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Public**         | Open, permissionless; anyone can participate          | Bitcoin, Ethereum               |
| **Private**        | Central authority controls participation              | Enterprise internal systems     |
| **Consortium**     | Controlled by a group of organizations                | Supply chain, banking consortia |
| **Hybrid**         | Mix of public and private features                    | Government and enterprise apps  |

## üßÆ Consensus Mechanisms

| Method                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proof of Work (PoW)** | Requires solving cryptographic puzzles (e.g., Bitcoin)                      |
| **Proof of Stake (PoS)**| Validators chosen based on stake (e.g., Ethereum 2.0)                       |
| **Delegated PoS (DPoS)**| Voting-based validator selection                                            |
| **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** | Agreement reached even with faulty or malicious nodes         |
