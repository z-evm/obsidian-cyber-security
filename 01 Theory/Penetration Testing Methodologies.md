**Penetration Testing** is a controlled simulation of real-world cyberattacks against a system, application, or organization to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Methodologies provide a **structured approach** to guide testing phases, scope, tools, and reporting.

## üéØ Objectives

- Identify exploitable vulnerabilities
- Validate the effectiveness of security controls
- Measure organizational response (detection, containment)
- Improve risk posture and incident readiness

## üß≠ Common Penetration Testing Methodologies

| Methodology         | Maintained By / Notes                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **OSSTMM**          | Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (ISECOM)  |
| **OWASP Testing Guide** | Focused on web apps, includes checklist and attack vectors |
| **NIST SP 800-115** | U.S. government standard for technical security testing   |
| **PTES**            | Penetration Testing Execution Standard                    |
| **MITRE ATT&CK**    | Threat emulation based on real-world adversary behavior   |
| **Red Team / Purple Team Frameworks** | Combine offense (Red) and defense (Blue) |

## üß± Phases of a Pen Test (PTES-Aligned)

| Phase              | Description                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Pre-Engagement** | Define scope, goals, targets, legal authorization, and rules     |
| **2. Intelligence Gathering** | Passive and active recon, OSINT, enumeration            |
| **3. Threat Modeling** | Identify attack vectors and high-value targets                 |
| **4. Vulnerability Analysis** | Identify flaws using scanning and manual analysis       |
| **5. Exploitation**      | Attempt to compromise systems or data                        |
| **6. Post-Exploitation** | Assess impact, pivot, escalate privileges                    |
| **7. Reporting**         | Document findings, evidence, risk rating, and remediation    |

## üîê Types of Pen Tests

| Type            | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Black Box**     | No internal knowledge of target (simulates external attacker) |
| **White Box**     | Full knowledge of system, credentials, and architecture       |
| **Gray Box**      | Partial knowledge (e.g., user credentials)                    |
| **External**      | Test from outside the perimeter (e.g., internet-facing apps)  |
| **Internal**      | Simulate insider threat or compromised asset scenario         |

## ‚úÖ To Do

- [ ] Create pen test checklist (pre-engagement through reporting)
- [ ] Add sample RoE and authorization form
- [ ] Build tool map for each PTES phase
- [ ] Compare OSSTMM vs PTES vs NIST 800-115
