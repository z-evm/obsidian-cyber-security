**Control Mapping** is the process of aligning and correlating **security controls** across different **frameworks**, **standards**, and **policies** to ensure unified risk management, eliminate redundancy, and demonstrate **compliance coverage** across regulatory domains.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Provide a **centralized view** of control effectiveness across multiple regulations (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, NIST).
- Simplify **auditing** and **compliance reporting** by avoiding duplicate effort.
- Facilitate **security program alignment** with business and regulatory objectives.
- Enable **continuous control monitoring** across multi-framework environments.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use a **single control source of truth** mapped to multiple frameworks.
- Tag controls with **framework IDs**, risk categories, and system scope.
- Use **automated tools** to update mappings as frameworks evolve.
- Prioritize **overlapping control coverage** to reduce audit overhead.
- Integrate control mapping with your **SSP**, **POA&M**, and audit evidence repository.

## üìö Compliance Alignment Use Cases

| Use Case                     | Benefit of Control Mapping                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-framework audits**    | Show how one control satisfies many requirements            |
| **FedRAMP/NIST + ISO alignment** | Harmonize cloud and global standards                       |
| **Policy documentation**      | Align policies with external compliance mandates            |
| **Risk management dashboards**| Visualize gaps or overlaps in control coverage              |
