**Red Teaming** is a structured, goal-oriented security exercise in which skilled security professionals simulate **real-world adversaries** to test an organization‚Äôs defenses, detection, and response capabilities.

It goes beyond simple penetration testing by focusing on **stealth, persistence, and realistic attacker behavior (TTPs)**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Red Teaming answers the question:**  
> _"Can an attacker breach us without being detected?"_

Goals:
- Simulate advanced, persistent threats (APT)
- Identify **vulnerabilities**, **misconfigurations**, and **detection gaps**
- Test incident response readiness
- Improve organizational **resilience** and **awareness**

## üß† Red Team vs Penetration Testing

| Attribute            | Penetration Testing                   | Red Teaming                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**            | Broad but limited to vulnerabilities   | Focused on achieving a mission objective        |
| **Duration**         | Short-term                             | Long-term (weeks/months)                        |
| **Stealth**          | Not prioritized                        | High priority                                   |
| **Detection**        | May trigger alerts                     | Avoids detection                                |
| **Objective**        | Find and report bugs                   | Test detection and response end-to-end          |

## üß± Red Teaming Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Gather info (OSINT, domain, assets)
2. **Initial Access** ‚Äì Phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities
3. **Persistence** ‚Äì Registry keys, scheduled tasks, services
4. **Privilege Escalation** ‚Äì Token impersonation, kernel exploits
5. **Lateral Movement** ‚Äì RDP, PsExec, SMB
6. **Collection** ‚Äì Capture credentials, documents
7. **Command & Control** ‚Äì Maintain covert comms
8. **Exfiltration** ‚Äì Extract sensitive data

## üìö Red Team Reporting

Deliverables often include:
- Executive Summary (business impact)
- Technical Report (attack chain, indicators, timelines)
- Risk Ratings
- Recommendations for remediation
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Align simulations with **MITRE ATT&CK TTPs**
- Define **clear rules of engagement (ROE)**
- Coordinate with the Blue Team post-engagement
- Always include a **debriefing and knowledge transfer**
- Don‚Äôt just exploit‚Äî**emulate threat actors**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations and Risks

- May trigger real-world alerts (notify SOC)
- Can disrupt operations if not properly scoped
- Requires **legal and ethical clearance**
- Should never be run against production without strict control
