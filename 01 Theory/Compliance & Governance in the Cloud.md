**Compliance and Governance in the Cloud** ensures that cloud resources and operations conform to **legal, regulatory, and internal policy requirements**. Governance defines **controls and responsibilities**, while compliance ensures they are **monitored, enforced, and auditable**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Align cloud operations with **industry regulations and internal security policies**.
- Define **ownership, accountability, and risk tolerance** in cloud environments.
- Implement **automated guardrails** to prevent misconfiguration and data leakage.
- Support **audit readiness** and **continuous assurance**.

## üß± Key Components

| Component             | Description                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy Definition**   | Create cloud-native security, identity, and data policies.              |
| **Control Mapping**     | Map security policies to frameworks like NIST, ISO, PCI-DSS.            |
| **Access Governance**   | Enforce least privilege, role-based access, and MFA.                    |
| **Data Governance**     | Classify, label, encrypt, and retain data based on sensitivity.         |
| **Logging & Monitoring**| Centralized audit logging, log retention, and anomaly detection.        |
| **Remediation Automation** | Auto-correct drift from policy using tools like config rules.         |

## üîê Common Compliance Challenges

- **Lack of visibility** across multi-cloud resources.
- **Shadow IT** and unsanctioned cloud service usage.
- **Inconsistent IAM practices** across platforms.
- **Manual compliance tracking** prone to human error.
- **Data sovereignty** and cross-border data transfer issues.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Define a **cloud governance model** and assign data stewards, security owners.
- Use **labeling and tagging standards** to track resources by owner and compliance scope.
- Implement **guardrails via policy engines** (deny by default, whitelist exceptions).
- Enable **centralized logging and SIEM forwarding** (e.g., CloudTrail, Azure Monitor).
- Schedule **regular audits**, and **continuous compliance scans**.
- Maintain **policy documentation**, version control, and change tracking.
