Risk treatment (also called risk response) refers to the **process of selecting and implementing measures to modify risk**. It is a core component of **risk management**, used to reduce the impact and/or likelihood of threats to organizational assets.

## 🎯 Risk Treatment Options

There are **four primary strategies** for treating risk:

| Strategy         | Description                                                                 | Example                                                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Risk Avoidance** | Eliminating the activity that introduces the risk.                          | Disabling a vulnerable service; rejecting a risky project.     |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Reducing the likelihood or impact of the risk.                             | Applying patches, adding encryption, using MFA.                |
| **Risk Transfer**   | Shifting the risk to a third party.                                        | Purchasing cyber insurance; outsourcing to a secure provider.  |
| **Risk Acceptance** | Acknowledging the risk and choosing not to take action.                    | Accepting low-cost, low-impact risk due to budget constraints. |

## 🔁 Extended Variations

- **Risk Sharing**: A form of risk transfer where risk is shared between parties (e.g., through partnerships or contracts).
- **Risk Exploitation** (used in positive risk contexts): Leveraging a risk to gain a potential benefit (common in project management, not cybersecurity).

## 🧠 How to Choose a Strategy

Factors to consider:

- **Risk tolerance** and **appetite** of the organization.
- **Cost vs benefit** of the control measures.
- **Legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations**.
- **Residual risk** after treatment.

---

## 📉 Residual Risk

> The remaining risk after controls are applied.

```text
Residual Risk = Total Risk – Risk Reduction from Controls
```

Example: If a $50,000 ALE is reduced to $10,000 after implementing controls, the **residual risk is $10,000**.

## 🛠️ Practical Application

- Use **risk register** to document treatment decisions.
- Align strategies with **organizational policy** and **compliance frameworks**.
- Regularly reassess to accommodate changes in the threat landscape.
