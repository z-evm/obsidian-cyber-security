**Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** refers to collecting publicly available information from free or commercial sources to support investigations, reconnaissance, and threat profiling. OSINT is widely used in **red teaming**, **social engineering**, **cyber threat intelligence**, and **pre-attack planning**.

## üéØ Use Cases

- Footprinting and reconnaissance  
- Phishing pretext development  
- Threat actor profiling  
- Asset discovery (domains, subdomains, IPs)  
- Leaked credential & breach analysis  
- Brand and infrastructure monitoring

## üß† Sample Queries

```bash
# theHarvester (emails/domains)
theHarvester -d example.com -b google

# DNS records
dig A example.com
dig MX example.com

# Google Dork: find exposed spreadsheets
site:example.com filetype:xls intext:password

# crt.sh: discover subdomains
https://crt.sh/?q=%.example.com
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Considerations

- Use WHOIS privacy and DNS security controls
- Regularly review public S3 buckets, GitHub repos, and certificate records
- Monitor for impersonation or brand abuse
- Strip metadata from public documents
- Train staff on OSINT and social engineering risk
