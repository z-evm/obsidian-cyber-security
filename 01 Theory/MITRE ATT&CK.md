**MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge) is a **globally-accessible knowledge base** of adversary behavior, based on real-world observations. It is widely used for **threat modeling**, **incident response**, **detection engineering**, and **red/blue teaming**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **MITRE ATT&CK answers the question:**  
> _"How do attackers behave once they gain access to a system?"_

The framework provides:
- A **common language** to describe cyberattacks
- Mapping between **threat actor behavior** and **defensive controls**
- A structure for **simulating and detecting** advanced persistent threats (APTs)

## üß± ATT&CK Structure

| Layer        | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tactic**   | The "goal" or objective of an attacker (e.g., Execution) |
| **Technique**| A method to achieve that goal (e.g., PowerShell)   |
| **Sub-technique** | Specific variations of a technique           |
| **Procedure**| Real-world use of techniques by adversaries        |

## üóÇ Example: Breakdown of a Tactic

| Element             | Value                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Tactic**           | Initial Access               |
| **Technique**        | Phishing (T1566)             |
| **Sub-technique**    | Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001) |
| **Procedure**        | Emotet email campaign uses malicious Word docs |

| Tactic                 | Objective                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Access**      | Gain entry into a network                         |
| **Execution**           | Run malicious code                                |
| **Persistence**         | Maintain presence                                 |
| **Privilege Escalation**| Gain higher-level access                          |
| **Defense Evasion**     | Bypass security measures                          |
| **Credential Access**   | Steal usernames/passwords                         |
| **Discovery**           | Explore the environment                           |
| **Lateral Movement**    | Move across systems                               |
| **Collection**          | Gather targeted data                              |
| **Command and Control** | Communicate with attacker infrastructure          |
| **Exfiltration**        | Steal and remove data                             |
| **Impact**              | Disrupt, destroy, or manipulate systems           |
