**HTTPS inspection and decryption** is the process of intercepting and analyzing encrypted HTTPS traffic to detect threats, enforce policy, and maintain visibility into user activity. It plays a critical role in modern **network security** and **data loss prevention**.

---

## üéØ Purpose of HTTPS Inspection

- Detect **malware** hidden in encrypted traffic
- Enforce **content filtering**, compliance, and DLP policies
- Block **command-and-control (C2)** communications
- Identify **phishing** or malicious downloads
- Prevent **data exfiltration** and shadow IT

---

## üîê Why Inspection is Needed

> As of today, over 90% of web traffic is encrypted using HTTPS.

Without inspection, **security tools become blind** to:

- Encrypted malware payloads
- Credential theft
- Insider threats using secure channels
- Suspicious or unauthorized SaaS access

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How HTTPS Inspection Works

1. A security device (e.g., firewall, proxy, UTM) intercepts HTTPS requests.
2. It **acts as a trusted MITM**, using its own **internal root certificate**.
3. The proxy **decrypts** and inspects the traffic.
4. If clean, it re-encrypts the session with the destination server.

> This process requires **trusted CA certificates** to be deployed on endpoints.

## üß© Components Required

| Component             | Description                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Decryption Proxy**   | Device or service that performs MITM (e.g., NGFW, SSL proxy) |
| **Internal Root CA**   | Trusted cert authority for resigning traffic |
| **Endpoint Trust**     | Devices must trust proxy CA to avoid cert warnings |
| **Policy Engine**      | Determines what to inspect or bypass         |

## üõ°Ô∏è Tools That Perform HTTPS Inspection

| Tool / Platform         | Type                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Palo Alto NGFW**       | Next-gen firewall           |
| **FortiGate**            | UTM with SSL inspection     |
| **Zscaler**              | Cloud-based proxy           |
| **Cisco Umbrella**       | Cloud DNS + decryption      |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** | Traffic visibility |
| **Squid Proxy (w/ SSL Bump)** | Open-source proxy        |

## üìä Use Cases

- ‚úÖ Block access to phishing or malware domains
- ‚úÖ Detect data exfiltration via HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Enforce acceptable use (block gambling, adult content, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Scan for malicious attachments or downloads
- ‚úÖ Apply DLP rules to encrypted file uploads

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy and Ethical Considerations

| Risk / Concern                  | Mitigation                                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **User privacy**                | Bypass sensitive apps (e.g., healthcare, banking) |
| **Compliance**                  | Align with GDPR, HIPAA, etc.                   |
| **Breakage of some services**   | Use exception lists or certificate pinning detection |
| **User trust**                  | Transparency, user consent, clear policies     |

---

## üö´ What Should Be Excluded from Inspection?

- Banking/financial apps
- Government portals
- Medical or personal health sites
- Sites using **certificate pinning** (will break if intercepted)

---

## üîê Certificate Pinning & Inspection

- Some apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal, banking) use **certificate pinning**
- Pinning compares server cert to hardcoded cert in app
- If mismatch: session fails or crashes
- **Bypass these domains** in HTTPS inspection policies

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Clearly define inspection/bypass policies
- ‚úÖ Deploy trusted internal CA across all endpoints
- ‚úÖ Log and alert on decrypted malicious traffic
- ‚úÖ Use **SSL fingerprinting** to identify evasion tools
- ‚úÖ Combine with **DLP**, **URL filtering**, and **malware scanning**
