**CIS Control 17** is part of the CIS Critical Security Controls v8 framework and focuses on establishing and maintaining an **incident response (IR) capability** to rapidly detect, contain, and recover from security events.

This control is essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents and enabling continuous improvement through lessons learned.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Enable organizations to **effectively respond** to cybersecurity incidents
- Reduce response time and scope of impact
- Ensure **repeatable**, **documented**, and **tested** response procedures

## üß± Sub-Controls Breakdown

| Sub-Control ID | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **17.1**        | Designate personnel to manage incident response         |
| **17.2**        | Establish and maintain an incident response process     |
| **17.3**        | Document incident response procedures/playbooks         |
| **17.4**        | Assign roles/responsibilities for incident handling     |
| **17.5**        | Determine thresholds for incident declaration/escalation|
| **17.6**        | Test incident response plans regularly (e.g., exercises)|
| **17.7**        | Conduct post-incident reviews and lessons learned       |

## üß† Implementation Guidance

- Use **tabletop exercises** and **red team drills**
- Align playbooks with the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework for realistic simulations
- Automate escalations and ticket creation using **SOAR platforms**
- Integrate with SIEM/EDR/XDR tools for real-time threat detection

## üß∞ Supporting Technologies

| Technology         | Role in Incident Response                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **SIEM**            | Aggregates logs and detects anomalies                |
| **EDR/XDR**         | Endpoint monitoring, threat isolation, root cause   |
| **SOAR**            | Orchestrates automated responses and workflows      |
| **Ticketing Systems**| Manages tasking, escalation, and evidence tracking |
| **Threat Intel Feeds**| Provides context and attribution                  |

## üß≠ Mapping to Other Frameworks

| Framework        | Related Elements                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **NIST 800-61**   | Entire lifecycle structure (Preparation ‚Üí Lessons)     |
| **NIST 800-53**   | IR-1 to IR-9 (policies, handling, lessons, sharing)    |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | A.16 (Information Security Incident Management)        |
| **MITRE ATT&CK**  | Used to simulate attack scenarios for IR testing       |

## üìå Best Practices

- Define **incident categories** and **severity levels**
- Maintain a **centralized IR playbook repository**
- Ensure **cross-functional coordination** (SOC, Legal, HR, PR)
- Periodically update the IR plan based on **real incidents**
