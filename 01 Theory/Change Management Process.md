**Change Management** is a structured approach to ensure that changes to IT systems, configurations, or infrastructure are implemented in a **controlled and secure** manner, reducing the risk of disruption or unintended consequences.

## 🎯 Objective

To ensure all changes are:
- 🔐 Secure
- 📋 Documented
- ✅ Approved
- 🔄 Reversible (if necessary)
- 🔍 Auditable

## 🧱 Key Phases of Change Management

| Phase               | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **1. Request**       | A formal change request (CR) is submitted, describing the nature, reason, and impact of the change. |
| **2. Assessment**    | Technical teams assess the risk, feasibility, and potential impact (including security implications). |
| **3. Approval**      | The change is reviewed and approved by a Change Advisory Board (CAB) or management. |
| **4. Implementation**| The change is deployed in a controlled manner, often during maintenance windows. |
| **5. Verification**  | Post-change testing is performed to confirm success and ensure no unintended effects. |
| **6. Documentation** | Final details are recorded, and configuration management databases (CMDBs) are updated. |
| **7. Review**        | A post-implementation review (PIR) is conducted for lessons learned and process improvement. |

## 🧠 Types of Changes

| Type        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Standard** | Pre-approved, low-risk, routine (e.g., software patching). |
| **Normal**   | Non-urgent changes that follow the full change process. |
| **Emergency**| Critical changes that bypass normal approval due to urgent business impact (e.g., zero-day mitigation). |

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

- 🕵️ **Auditability** — Logs and documentation for compliance.
- 🔐 **Access Control** — Limit who can approve or execute changes.
- 📉 **Rollback Plans** — Must include contingencies in case of failure.
- 💣 **Segregation of Duties** — Prevents conflict of interest in change approval and implementation.
