The **Change Control Process** is a structured workflow used to manage and approve modifications to systems, configurations, software, or infrastructure in a controlled and secure manner. It ensures **stability, security, and accountability** in IT environments.

## üéØ Objectives

- Prevent unauthorized or poorly implemented changes
- Minimize disruption and reduce risk of outages or vulnerabilities
- Maintain compliance with industry and regulatory standards
- Track, document, and review all changes for transparency

## üß± Key Phases in Change Control

| Phase                    | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Request**            | Change is proposed via a formal Change Request (CR)         |
| **2. Assessment**         | Evaluate impact, risk, and resource requirements            |
| **3. Approval**           | Change Advisory Board (CAB) or management grants approval   |
| **4. Implementation**     | Change is executed using approved procedures                |
| **5. Validation**         | Change is tested and monitored for success                  |
| **6. Documentation**      | Record update in CMDB or change log                         |
| **7. Review**             | Post-change evaluation and lessons learned                  |

## üîê Security Considerations

| Control Area            | Risk Without Change Control               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Unauthorized Changes** | Could introduce malware or misconfigurations |
| **Configuration Drift**  | Weakens system baselines and auditability |
| **Downtime & Data Loss** | Poorly tested changes can break systems    |
| **Compliance Violations**| Failure to document changes affects audits |

## üß∞ Tools & Platforms

| Tool/Platform          | Purpose                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **ITSM Tools**          | ServiceNow, Jira, Freshservice (CR tracking) |
| **CMDB** (Config Mgmt DB)| Maps assets and associated change history    |
| **Version Control Systems** | Git, SVN (codebase change control)       |
| **Infrastructure-as-Code** | Ansible, Terraform (repeatable changes)   |

## üß≠ Framework Alignment

| Framework        | Relevant Controls                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **NIST 800-53**   | CM-3 (Change Control), CM-4 (Monitoring Changes)|
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | A.12.1.2 (Change Management), A.14.2.4          |
| **CIS Controls**  | Control 4.8 (Document/Review all system changes)|
| **ITIL v4**       | Change Enablement (standard, normal, emergency)|

## üìù Types of Change

| Type        | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard** | Low-risk, routine changes (e.g., OS patching)      |
| **Normal**   | Higher-impact changes requiring full approval      |
| **Emergency**| Urgent changes to fix critical issues (e.g., zero-day patching) |

---

## üìå Best Practices

- Use change templates for repeatable tasks
- Require rollback procedures in CRs
- Involve security and compliance teams in high-risk reviews
- Tag all changes with asset IDs for traceability
