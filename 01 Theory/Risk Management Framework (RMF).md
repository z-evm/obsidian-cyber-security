The **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is a structured process that integrates **security, privacy, and risk management** into the system development lifecycle (SDLC). It supports informed decision-making and compliance with **FISMA** and other standards.

> 🛡️ Defined in **NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of RMF

- 📋 Establish a repeatable, risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- ✅ Ensure systems are authorized before operation
- 🔁 Promote continuous monitoring and control improvement
- ⚖️ Align risk with organizational mission and tolerance

## 🧱 RMF 7-Step Process

| Step | Name                          | Purpose                                                   |
|------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Prepare**                   | Establish context, governance, roles, and priorities       |
| 2    | **Categorize**                | Categorize information and systems by impact level (FIPS 199) |
| 3    | **Select Controls**           | Choose baseline controls from **NIST SP 800-53**           |
| 4    | **Implement Controls**        | Apply technical, management, and operational safeguards    |
| 5    | **Assess Controls**           | Verify control effectiveness via testing and documentation |
| 6    | **Authorize System**          | Decision by Authorizing Official (AO) to operate system    |
| 7    | **Monitor Controls**          | Continuous assessment, updates, and response to changes    |

## 🧩 Step Details

### 🔧 Step 1: Prepare
- Define stakeholders, assets, and responsibilities
- Establish risk tolerance and threat sources
- Inventory systems and environments

### 🧪 Step 2: Categorize
- Use **FIPS 199** to determine **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)** impact levels: Low, Moderate, High

### 📦 Step 3: Select Controls
- Tailor **NIST SP 800-53** control baselines based on impact level
- Document selected controls in a **System Security Plan (SSP)**

### 🛠 Step 4: Implement Controls
- Configure, document, and test controls
- May include technical, procedural, and physical safeguards

### 📋 Step 5: Assess Controls
- Conduct assessments to determine if controls are correctly implemented
- Produce a **Security Assessment Report (SAR)**

### 🧾 Step 6: Authorize
- **Authorizing Official (AO)** reviews SSP, SAR, and POA&M
- Grant Authorization to Operate (ATO), Denial, or Interim ATO

### 🔄 Step 7: Monitor
- Perform continuous monitoring (e.g., SIEM, audits, threat intel)
- Maintain POA&M (Plan of Action and Milestones)
- Respond to configuration or threat changes

## 🧠 RMF Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibility                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **System Owner**        | Owns system risk and compliance posture    |
| **Authorizing Official (AO)** | Approves/denies system operation        |
| **Security Control Assessor (SCA)** | Tests and validates control effectiveness |
| **Information System Security Officer (ISSO)** | Oversees control implementation     |

---

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

- Ongoing control effectiveness review
- Incident response integration
- Trigger reauthorization if major changes occur

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Tailor controls early using risk context
- Automate monitoring with tools and dashboards
- Keep documentation up to date (SSP, SAR, POA&M)
- Integrate RMF into DevSecOps pipelines for agility
- Link RMF efforts to **NIST CSF** and **organizational mission**
