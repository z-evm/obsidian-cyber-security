**Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)** encompasses the policies, frameworks, and controls used to **secure the physical and cyber assets** essential to the functioning of society, including energy, water, transportation, communications, and defense.

CIP is a **national security priority** due to the potential **life-threatening and economic impact** of attacks or failures in these systems.

## 🧱 What is Critical Infrastructure?

According to many global frameworks (e.g., NIST, DHS, AU Gov), **Critical Infrastructure** includes:

| Sector                     | Examples                                           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 🛢 Energy                  | Power grids, oil pipelines, nuclear facilities     |
| 🚰 Water & Wastewater     | Treatment plants, pumping stations                 |
| 🏥 Healthcare             | Hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing            |
| 🛰 Communications         | ISPs, satellites, mobile networks                  |
| 🚚 Transportation Systems | Airports, shipping ports, railways                 |
| 💳 Financial Services     | Banks, stock exchanges, ATMs                       |
| 🏛 Government Facilities  | Courts, defense facilities, emergency services     |
| 🧱 Critical Manufacturing | Semiconductors, steel, chemical production         |
| 🛡 Defense Industrial Base| Defense contractors, military suppliers            |
| 🌾 Food & Agriculture     | Processing plants, distribution centers            |

## 🎯 Goals of CIP

- 🛡 **Prevent disruption** of critical services
- ⚙ **Resilience**: ensure rapid recovery post-incident
- 🕵️ **Detect and respond** to cyber and physical threats
- 📋 **Comply** with national and sector-specific regulations
- 🔄 Promote **public-private coordination**

## 🛠 Best Practices for CIP

- 🧾 Identify and classify **critical assets**
- 🔐 Apply **defense-in-depth**: cyber, physical, personnel
- 🧱 Segment networks (IT/OT separation, DMZ)
- 🔁 Implement **redundancy** and **high availability**
- 🧪 Perform regular **tabletop exercises and red teaming**
- 📢 Establish **public-private collaboration** mechanisms
