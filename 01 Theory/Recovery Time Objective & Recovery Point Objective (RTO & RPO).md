**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** are two essential metrics used in **disaster recovery** and **business continuity planning**. They define acceptable levels of **downtime** and **data loss** following a disruptive event.

---

## 🧱 Definitions

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **RTO** *(Recovery Time Objective)* | The maximum acceptable time it should take to restore a system, application, or service after a disruption. |
| **RPO** *(Recovery Point Objective)* | The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (i.e., how old the data can be upon recovery). |

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **RTO** defines the **urgency of recovery**: How fast must services be restored?
- **RPO** defines the **data currency**: How much data can we afford to lose?

These metrics help prioritize systems, select backup strategies, and guide investments in **resiliency technologies**.

## 📊 Visual Example

```
Event Timeline:  
|------RPO------|----- Downtime ------|  
| Data Loss | Recovery Time |  
--|---------------|---------------------|-->  
Failure Last Good Backup Service Restored

## 🧠 Business Impact Scenarios

| System               | RTO       | RPO       | Justification                                        |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| E-commerce platform  | <1 hour   | <15 min   | Every minute down = lost revenue + customer trust   |
| Email services       | 2 hours   | 1 hour    | Important, but not mission-critical                  |
| HR/Payroll system    | 24 hours  | 12 hours  | Needed periodically, not real-time                   |
| Archival database    | 72 hours  | 24 hours  | Long-term access only; downtime is tolerable         |

## 🔁 Influencing Factors

| Metric | Influenced By                                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RTO** | System criticality, SLA commitments, DR site readiness     |
| **RPO** | Backup frequency, replication interval, data volatility    |

## 🔧 Technologies to Meet RTO & RPO

| RTO Focused Solutions            | RPO Focused Solutions                |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| - Hot Sites                      | - Real-time replication              |
| - Cloud Failover / DRaaS         | - Continuous Data Protection (CDP)   |
| - Virtual Machine Snapshots      | - Frequent incremental backups       |
| - Automation/Orchestration Tools | - Database log shipping              |

## ✅ Best Practices

- Conduct a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** to define RTO/RPO by system.
- Prioritize **mission-critical systems** for lowest RTO/RPO values.
- Regularly **test recovery capabilities** to validate targets are met.
- Monitor and tune **backup windows**, replication speeds, and storage performance.
- Align RTO/RPO with **SLA** and **compliance requirements**.
