A **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** is a documented and tested strategy for recovering IT systems, infrastructure, and data after a disruptive event. It supports operational resilience, minimizes downtime, and is a core component of business continuity.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Restore **critical IT services** following an incident.
- Limit **financial losses**, **data loss**, and **downtime**.
- Support **regulatory compliance** and internal risk management.
- Ensure alignment with business impact priorities.

## üîÅ DRP Lifecycle

| Phase                   | Description                                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Risk Assessment**  | Identify threats and vulnerabilities affecting IT operations.         |
| **2. BIA (Business Impact Analysis)** | Evaluate critical systems, downtime tolerance, and impact.      |
| **3. Recovery Strategy Development** | Define options (cloud, backup, hot sites, etc.).               |
| **4. Plan Design**      | Document recovery steps, roles, and systems.                          |
| **5. Testing & Training** | Validate DR effectiveness through exercises.                       |
| **6. Maintenance**      | Review after incidents or major changes.                             |

## üß± Key Components of a DRP

| Component                     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope & Objectives**        | Boundaries of the plan and specific recovery goals.                         |
| **Critical Assets**           | Prioritized systems, applications, data, and infrastructure.                |
| **RTO/RPO Definitions**       | Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO).              |
| **Recovery Procedures**       | Step-by-step instructions for restoring services.                           |
| **Roles & Responsibilities**  | DR team structure and emergency contacts.                                   |
| **Alternate Facilities**      | Hot, warm, or cold sites for failover.                                      |
| **Backup Strategy**           | Frequency, media, storage, encryption, and retention.                       |
| **Communication Plan**        | Internal and external updates during disruption.                            |
| **Testing Plan**              | Tabletop, simulation, or full-scale exercises.                              |
| **Plan Maintenance**          | Periodic review, audit alignment, and post-incident updates.                |

## ‚è± Recovery Objectives

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **RTO** *(Recovery Time Objective)* | Max acceptable time to restore operations. |
| **RPO** *(Recovery Point Objective)* | Max acceptable data loss, measured in time. |
| **MTPD** *(Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption)* | Absolute outage limit before mission failure. |

## üß† Recovery Strategies

| Strategy         | Description                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backup & Restore** | Data backups with recovery tested for integrity and timing.     |
| **Cloud Failover**   | Auto-failover to cloud infrastructure or services.              |
| **Site Redundancy**  | Use of alternate physical locations (hot, warm, cold sites).    |
| **Virtualization**   | Restore VMs from snapshots or golden images.                    |
| **DRaaS**            | Disaster Recovery as a Service ‚Äì vendor-managed recovery suite. |

## üß™ DRP Testing Types

| Type              | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tabletop**       | Simulated discussion and walkthroughs with stakeholders. |
| **Checklist Review** | Validate plan completeness and accuracy.              |
| **Simulation**     | Partial recovery of components in a controlled test.     |
| **Parallel**       | Run recovery systems concurrently with production.       |
| **Full Interruption** | Shutdown of production to validate total failover.     |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Align DRP with [[Business Impact Analysis (BIA)]] and [[Business Continuity Planning (BCP)]].
- Store copies of DRP **offsite and digitally encrypted**.
- Test DRP **annually or after major changes**.
- Clearly define **escalation procedures** and **communication trees**.
- Document post-exercise [[After Action Report (AAR)]] and corrective actions.
