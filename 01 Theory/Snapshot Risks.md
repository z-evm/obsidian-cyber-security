Virtual machine (VM) snapshots are point-in-time images used for backup, testing, and rollback purposes. While useful for recovery and dev/test environments, snapshots can introduce significant security and operational risks if not properly managed.

## üß± What Is a Snapshot?

A snapshot captures the current state of a VM, including:
- Disk state (including memory if specified)
- CPU/memory configuration
- Virtual hardware settings

> üîÅ Snapshots are **not** backups‚Äîthey depend on the original VM files and are intended for short-term use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Snapshot-Related Risks

### 1. **Data Exposure**
- Snapshots may contain sensitive credentials, secrets, or memory-resident data (e.g., in RAM dumps).
- **Threat**: Exfiltration or unauthorized access to confidential data.

### 2. **Persistence of Vulnerabilities**
- If a VM snapshot is restored, any unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfigurations present at the time of snapshot creation reappear.
- **Impact**: Reintroduction of known vulnerabilities into production.

### 3. **Storage Exhaustion**
- Multiple or large snapshots consume disk space rapidly.
- **Consequence**: VM crashes or host performance degradation.

### 4. **Snapshot Sprawl**
- Untracked or forgotten snapshots accumulate over time.
- **Risk**: Poor version control, operational confusion, and compliance failures.

### 5. **Unauthorized Reversion**
- Attackers or untrained staff may roll back VMs to older, insecure states.
- **Threat**: Bypass of security updates or audit trails.

### 6. **Tampering & Integrity Issues**
- Snapshots can be tampered with offline (e.g., inserting backdoors).
- **Concern**: Restoring compromised VM states unknowingly.

## üõ° Mitigation Strategies

| Category        | Control                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Access Control** | Restrict snapshot creation/reversion to authorized personnel |
| **Encryption**     | Encrypt snapshot files and storage backends |
| **Monitoring**     | Log and audit all snapshot operations |
| **Retention Policy**| Implement lifecycle rules to delete old snapshots |
| **Isolation**      | Store snapshots securely and separate from production disks |
| **Backup Hygiene** | Don‚Äôt use snapshots as backups‚Äîuse proper backup tools |

## üîß Snapshot Best Practices

- Label snapshots clearly (e.g., `pre-patch-2025-07-31`).
- Avoid long-term storage of snapshots in production.
- Regularly review and prune unused snapshots.
- Ensure automated backup systems don‚Äôt include outdated snapshots.
- Protect snapshot metadata and APIs (e.g., in cloud platforms like AWS or Azure).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Snapshot Risks in Cloud Environments

| Platform | Risk Example                               | Mitigation                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **AWS**  | Exposed EBS snapshots                      | Make snapshots private or encrypted  |
| **Azure**| Orphaned managed disk snapshots            | Regular review & cleanup             |
| **GCP**  | Reusable image snapshots with hardcoded creds | Use secrets management + access control |
