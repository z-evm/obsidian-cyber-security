**Code Signing** is the process of digitally signing software code or scripts to verify the **publisher's identity** and ensure the **integrity** of the code. It helps users and systems **trust** that the code has not been tampered with since it was signed.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure the **authenticity** of the software publisher.
- Provide **integrity assurance** that code was not altered post-signing.
- Enable **trust** in the software supply chain and secure deployment.
- Support **compliance**, **application whitelisting**, and **secure boot processes**.

---

## üß± How Code Signing Works

1. Developer generates a **hash** of the code.
2. The hash is **encrypted with the publisher's private key** (digital signature).
3. The **public certificate** and signature are embedded into the code.
4. When executed or downloaded:
   - The OS or application **validates the signature** using the **public key**.
   - It **hashes the code** again and checks if it matches the signed hash.

## üóùÔ∏è Code Signing Certificates

| Type                   | Description                                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-Signed Certificate** | Internal use, developer testing, not trusted by OS or browsers       |
| **CA-Signed Certificate**   | Issued by trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., DigiCert, Sectigo)     |
| **Extended Validation (EV)** | Requires rigorous identity verification, used for higher trust apps |

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows OS**      | SmartScreen, UAC, Device Guard                  |
| **macOS**           | Gatekeeper, notarization                        |
| **iOS / Android**   | App Store validation and enforcement            |
| **Browsers**        | Signed extensions or applets (e.g., Java, Chrome) |
| **Linux**           | Kernel module and package signing (e.g., RPM, APT) |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Store private keys in **HSMs** or secure vaults (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS).
- Use **short-lived certificates** and **automated rotation** when possible.
- Sign code in **build pipelines**, not on developer endpoints.
- Use **timestamping** to ensure signature validity after cert expiration.
- Maintain a **certificate revocation and update plan**.
- Verify signatures in deployment and during execution (e.g., secure boot).
