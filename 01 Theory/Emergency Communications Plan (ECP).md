An **Emergency Communications Plan (ECP)** defines how an organization will communicate internally and externally during a disruptive event. It ensures timely, accurate, and coordinated messaging to support incident response, protect lives, and maintain operations.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure effective **communication during emergencies** (natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics, etc.).
- Facilitate **coordination** between internal teams, stakeholders, and external responders.
- Maintain **situational awareness** and reduce misinformation.
- Meet compliance and regulatory obligations for crisis communication.

## üß± Key Components of an ECP

| Component                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication Objectives** | Define what needs to be communicated, to whom, and why.                     |
| **Stakeholder Directory**    | Contact information for key personnel, vendors, first responders, regulators.|
| **Communication Channels**   | Primary and secondary methods (e.g., email, SMS, satellite, radio, VOIP).  |
| **Notification Procedures**  | Step-by-step instructions for alerting staff, public, or authorities.      |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Designated individuals for communication tasks (e.g., spokesperson, PIO).   |
| **Message Templates**        | Pre-approved language for alerts, status updates, or evacuation notices.   |
| **Backup/Redundancy**        | Alternative systems in case primary methods fail.                          |
| **Information Security**     | Procedures to prevent disclosure of sensitive or misleading info.          |
| **Training and Testing**     | Regular drills and reviews to ensure readiness.                            |

## üìû Communication Methods (Examples)

| Type               | Tools/Channels                                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal**        | Mass email, text alerts, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Intranet               |
| **External**        | Press releases, public hotlines, social media, regulatory portals       |
| **Emergency**       | Satellite phones, HAM radios, backup cell towers, out-of-band alerts    |
| **Coordination**    | Conference bridges, secure chat (e.g., Signal, encrypted Zoom), ICS protocols |

## üîÅ Activation Triggers

- Detected cyber incident or data breach  
- Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires)  
- Workplace violence or public health emergencies  
- System outages affecting communication infrastructure  
- Facility evacuation or lockdown  

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Maintain an **offline version** of the ECP.
- Validate contact details quarterly.
- Integrate with [[Incident Response Plan (IRP)]] and [[Business Continuity Planning (BCP)]].
- Establish **multi-layered communication paths** (e.g., primary + 2 backups).
- Conduct **tabletop exercises** simulating various emergencies.
