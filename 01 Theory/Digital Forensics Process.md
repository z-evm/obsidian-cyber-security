**Digital forensics** is the practice of collecting, analyzing, preserving, and presenting electronic evidence. It plays a key role in cybersecurity investigations, legal cases, and incident response.

## üéØ Objectives

- üîç Identify and collect digital evidence
- üì¶ Preserve integrity and maintain chain of custody
- üß† Analyze systems, logs, and files for root cause
- ‚öñÔ∏è Provide admissible evidence for legal or disciplinary action

## üîÑ Phases of the Digital Forensics Process

### 1. üìã Identification
- Recognize the incident and potential digital evidence
- Scope systems, users, networks involved
- Define forensic goals (e.g., insider threat, malware, data theft)

### 2. üîê Preservation
- Prevent alteration of evidence
- Isolate affected systems
- **Maintain chain of custody**
- Use write blockers, disk imaging tools

### 3. üì• Collection
- Acquire data from:
  - Hard drives
  - Memory (RAM)
  - Logs (SIEM, firewalls, OS)
  - Network traffic captures
- Create cryptographic hashes to verify integrity

### 4. üß† Examination
- Review files, directories, metadata, timestamps
- Perform keyword and hash-based searches
- Extract artifacts (e.g., browser history, deleted files)

### 5. üß¨ Analysis
- Reconstruct timeline of events
- Identify malware, persistence mechanisms, lateral movement
- Correlate across data sources (e.g., logs, images, memory dumps)

### 6. üßæ Reporting
- Document findings clearly and completely
- Provide timeline of events, evidence summaries
- Prepare for legal presentation or internal decision-making

## üîê Chain of Custody

> A chronological record showing who handled the evidence, when, and how.

### Includes:
- Case ID
- Evidence description
- Date/time of collection
- Custodian names and signatures
- Integrity checks (e.g., hashes)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Ensure evidence is **admissible in court**
- Follow internal policies and laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
- Avoid contamination or destruction of evidence
- Document all actions in detail
