An **Incident Response (IR) Framework** provides a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. It minimizes damage, reduces recovery time and cost, and limits the impact of incidents on business operations.

## 🏛 Framework Standard

The **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2**: *Computer Security Incident Handling Guide* is the most widely adopted incident response standard.

## 🔄 NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

| Phase           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Preparation**       | Develop policies, procedures, and tools to handle incidents effectively |
| **2. Detection & Analysis** | Identify indicators of compromise and determine scope/severity          |
| **3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery** | Stop the incident, remove threats, restore systems       |
| **4. Post-Incident Activity** | Document findings, analyze root causes, update IR plans             |

---

## 📦 1. Preparation

- Develop incident response plan (IRP)
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Establish communication plans (internal/external)
- Train personnel and run tabletop exercises
- Ensure logging, backups, and monitoring are in place

---

## 🕵️ 2. Detection & Analysis

- Monitor logs, alerts, threat intelligence
- Use SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR tools
- Analyze indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Classify and prioritize incidents (e.g., malware, insider threat, DoS)
- Document the timeline and affected assets

---

## 🔐 3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery

### 🔒 Containment
- Isolate affected systems (e.g., disconnect from network)
- Prevent further damage and spread

### 🧹 Eradication
- Identify and remove root cause (e.g., malware, accounts, vulnerabilities)

### ♻️ Recovery
- Restore systems from backups
- Monitor for reinfection
- Validate integrity and functionality

---

## 🧾 4. Post-Incident Activity

- Conduct **lessons learned** meeting
- Document what happened and how it was handled
- Update incident response and security policies
- Report findings to stakeholders and regulators (if required)
- Improve detection and response tools

## 🔧 Incident Response Team (IRT) Roles

| Role              | Responsibility                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **IR Manager**    | Leads and coordinates the entire response process         |
| **Forensic Analyst** | Collects and analyzes digital evidence                  |
| **Communications Officer** | Manages internal/external communication and reporting |
| **System Administrator** | Assists with containment and recovery efforts       |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **playbooks** for common incidents (e.g., phishing, ransomware)
- Maintain a **chain of custody** for digital evidence
- Automate detection and response where possible
- Test the IR plan **regularly**
- Ensure IR aligns with **business continuity** and **disaster recovery** plans

---

## 🧰 Supporting Tools

- **SIEMs**: Splunk, QRadar, LogRhythm
- **EDR**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Defender for Endpoint
- **Forensics**: FTK, EnCase, Volatility
- **Threat Intel**: MISP, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB
