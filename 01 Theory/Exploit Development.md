**Exploit Development** is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in software or systems and crafting code that takes advantage of them to achieve unauthorized actions—such as code execution, privilege escalation, or bypassing controls.

This topic sits at the intersection of **vulnerability research**, **reverse engineering**, and **offensive security**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Exploit Development

- Demonstrate security flaws in real-world scenarios
- Aid in penetration testing and red teaming
- Support vulnerability disclosure and patch validation
- Understand attacker techniques (TTPs) for defense

> ⚠️ Ethical use only: Should follow **responsible disclosure policies** and legal boundaries.

## 🧱 Exploit Development Workflow

1. 🔍 **Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Manual code audit
   - Fuzzing
   - Reverse engineering
2. 🔬 **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Determine exploitability
   - Identify root cause (buffer overflow, format string, logic flaw, etc.)
3. 🛠 **Exploit Crafting**
   - Write PoC (proof of concept)
   - Chain primitives (e.g., info leak → RCE)
4. 🧪 **Testing**
   - Local test environment
   - Virtual machines (e.g., Kali, Metasploitable)
5. 🎯 **Payload Delivery**
   - Shellcode injection
   - Exploit modules (e.g., Metasploit)
6. 🔐 **Cleanup / Reporting**
   - Sanitize evidence
   - Document the flaw for vendor or internal fix
