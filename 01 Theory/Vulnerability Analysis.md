**Vulnerability Analysis** is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing weaknesses in systems, applications, and infrastructure that could be exploited by threat actors.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Discover vulnerabilities before attackers do.
- Assess the potential **impact** and **likelihood** of exploitation.
- Provide actionable data for **remediation** and **risk mitigation**.
- Support compliance with security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, NIST, ISO 27001).

## üß¨ Key Phases of Vulnerability Analysis

| Phase              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Planning**     | Define scope, targets, tools, and rules of engagement                     |
| **2. Discovery**    | Identify assets, open ports, services, software versions                  |
| **3. Scanning**     | Run vulnerability scanners against target systems                         |
| **4. Analysis**     | Interpret scanner output, validate results, assess false positives        |
| **5. Prioritization**| Rank vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, business impact |
| **6. Reporting**    | Document findings and recommend remediation actions                       |

## üõ† Common Tools

| Tool                | Type                     | Usage Example                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Nessus**          | Commercial scanner        | Network vulnerability assessment            |
| **OpenVAS**         | Open-source scanner       | Comprehensive scanning of systems           |
| **Nmap**            | Port scanning             | Discover hosts/services, version info       |
| **Nikto**           | Web server scanner        | Detect outdated software and misconfigs     |
| **Burp Suite**      | Web vulnerability testing | Manual & automated web app testing          |
| **Qualys**          | Cloud-based scanner       | Asset discovery and vulnerability mgmt      |

## üìä Vulnerability Scoring (CVSS)

| Metric              | Description                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Base Score**      | Fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability     |
| **Temporal Score**  | Accounts for exploit code maturity, remediation    |
| **Environmental Score** | Adjusted based on the target environment       |

> Example: CVSS v3.1 Base Score of **9.8** = Critical severity

## üß± Vulnerability vs Exploit

| Concept       | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness or flaw in a system or application           |
| **Exploit**       | A method/tool to take advantage of that vulnerability   |
| **Payload**       | Code that executes post-exploitation (e.g., reverse shell)|

## üõ° Integration with Security Controls

| Control Type    | Integration Example                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**  | Patch management, code reviews, secure configuration        |
| **Detective**   | Regular scanning, SIEM alerting on exploit attempts         |
| **Corrective**  | Remediation of detected flaws, system restoration           |
| **Directive**   | Security policies for code updates and asset lifecycle      |
