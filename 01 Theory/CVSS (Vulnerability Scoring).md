The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is a standardized framework for rating the **severity** of software vulnerabilities. It helps security teams assess risk and prioritize remediation.

Maintained by **FIRST.org**, CVSS scores are used in vulnerability databases like **NVD**, and referenced by CVEs.

## 🎯 Purpose of CVSS

- Quantify and **standardize vulnerability severity**
- Help organizations **prioritize remediation**
- Enable automation across scanners, patch tools, and SIEMs
- Support compliance and risk management decisions

## 🧬 CVSS v3.1 Score Structure

A CVSS score ranges from **0.0 to 10.0**, and is calculated based on three metric groups:

### 1. **Base Metrics** (Intrinsic & constant)
| Metric             | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Vector (AV)**    | How remote the attacker can be              |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)**| How difficult the exploit is to execute     |
| **Privileges Required (PR)**| Level of privileges attacker must have  |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | Whether user action is required             |
| **Scope (S)**              | Whether exploit affects other components   |
| **Confidentiality (C)**    | Data disclosure impact                     |
| **Integrity (I)**          | Data tampering/modification impact         |
| **Availability (A)**       | Service disruption impact                  |

### 2. **Temporal Metrics** (May change over time)
| Metric             | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Exploit Code Maturity** | Public availability of exploit code       |
| **Remediation Level**     | Patch availability                        |
| **Report Confidence**     | Certainty of vulnerability details        |

### 3. **Environmental Metrics** (Org-specific)
| Metric             | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Modified Base Metrics** | Customized impact for local environment    |
| **Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability Requirements** | Priority for org |

## 🔢 Score Ranges

| Score Range | Severity  | Risk Description                           |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| **0.0**     | None      | No impact                                  |
| **0.1–3.9** | Low       | Minor risk; hard to exploit                 |
| **4.0–6.9** | Medium    | Moderate risk; exploitable with constraints |
| **7.0–8.9** | High      | Serious risk; widely exploitable            |
| **9.0–10.0**| Critical  | Easy to exploit, severe impact              |

> Example: `CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue)` → **CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)**

## 📍 CVSS in Action

- **Vulnerability Scanners** (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) report CVSS scores
- **Patch Management** teams prioritize based on scores
- **Threat Intelligence** analysts track critical CVSS scores
- **SIEMs/EDRs** may use scores in rule logic or alerts

## 🚫 Limitations

- Doesn't assess **exploitability in real-world context**
- High CVSS ≠ active exploitation (combine with threat intel)
- Can be skewed if **Environmental Metrics** are not set
