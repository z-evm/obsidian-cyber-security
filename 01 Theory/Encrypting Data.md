**Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext using a **mathematical algorithm** and **cryptographic key**. It ensures **confidentiality**, protects against unauthorized access, and is foundational to **data security**.

> "If someone steals your data, encryption ensures they can't read it."

## üéØ Goals of Encryption

- **Confidentiality**: Prevent data disclosure to unauthorized parties
- **Integrity**: Ensure data hasn‚Äôt been tampered with (via cryptographic hashes)
- **Authentication**: Verify identity using cryptographic keys or certificates
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent denial of sending or receiving a message

## üß± Types of Encryption

| Type                 | Description                                      | Common Use Cases             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Symmetric**        | Same key for encryption and decryption           | File encryption, VPN, TLS bulk data |
| **Asymmetric**       | Public key encrypts, private key decrypts        | Email, digital signatures, key exchange |
| **Hashing (1-way)**  | Irreversible, used for integrity checking        | Password storage, file checksums |

---

## üîê Symmetric Encryption

- **Fast and efficient**
- Key must be **kept secret** and securely exchanged
- Examples:
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  - DES / 3DES (legacy)
  - Blowfish / Twofish

### üîß Example (AES-256 in OpenSSL):
```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc
```

## üîê Asymmetric Encryption

- Uses **key pairs** (public/private)
- Enables **secure key exchange** and **digital signatures**
- Slower than symmetric, but more secure for identity and communication

|Algorithm|Key Size|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|RSA|2048+ bits|Secure email, signatures|
|ECC|256+ bits|Mobile-friendly, lightweight|
|ElGamal|Variable|Used in PGP, secure messages|

## üì¶ Encryption at Rest vs In Transit

|Type|Description|Tools & Protocols|
|---|---|---|
|**At Rest**|Data stored on disk, USB, backups|BitLocker, LUKS, VeraCrypt, AWS KMS|
|**In Transit**|Data moving across a network|TLS, SSH, VPN, IPsec|
|**In Use**|Data processed in memory (less protected)|Encrypted computation, TEE (SGX)|

---

## üß† Common Protocols and Tools

|Protocol / Tool|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**TLS/SSL**|Secure web traffic (HTTPS)|
|**PGP/GPG**|Encrypt emails and files|
|**BitLocker**|Full disk encryption (Windows)|
|**LUKS/dm-crypt**|Full disk encryption (Linux)|
|**OpenVPN / IPsec**|Secure network tunnels|
|**SSH / SFTP**|Encrypted remote access and file transfer|
|**AWS KMS / Azure Key Vault**|Managed key encryption|

---

## üß† Encryption Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Key Exchange**|Securely share symmetric keys (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)|
|**Digital Signature**|Encrypt hash with private key for integrity/auth|
|**Certificate**|Binds identity to a public key (via CA)|
|**Entropy**|Randomness used to strengthen key generation|

---

## üìò Example Use Case: File Encryption Workflow

1. Generate AES symmetric key
2. Encrypt file with AES key
3. Encrypt AES key with recipient‚Äôs public key (RSA)
4. Send both encrypted file + encrypted AES key

‚Üí Recipient uses private key to decrypt AES key  
‚Üí Then decrypts file with AES key

## üß© Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR / HIPAA / PCI-DSS** require encryption of sensitive data
- **FIPS 140-2** outlines standards for approved cryptographic modules
- **NIST SP 800-111** offers guidance on storage encryption

---

## üõ° Best Practices

- Use **AES-256** for symmetric encryption
- Never **hard-code keys** into applications
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
- Store encryption keys in **HSMs** or **vaults**
- Always combine encryption with **access control and auditing**
- Encrypt **backups**, **logs**, and **config files**
