> The Encryption Lifecycle outlines the phases in which data is protected using cryptographic methods ‚Äî from creation and storage to transmission, use, and secure destruction.

---

## üìå Why It Matters

- Encryption is not a one-time event ‚Äî it must be managed **across the data lifecycle**.
- Secure encryption involves **key generation**, **distribution**, **rotation**, and **retirement**.
- Crucial for **compliance**, **confidentiality**, and **data integrity**.

## üß† Phases of the Encryption Lifecycle

| Phase                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Key Generation**   | Strong cryptographic keys are created using secure algorithms              |
| **2. Key Distribution** | Keys are securely shared with authorized entities                          |
| **3. Key Storage**      | Keys are stored securely (e.g., in HSMs, key vaults, TPMs)                 |
| **4. Data Encryption**  | Data is encrypted at rest, in transit, or in use                           |
| **5. Key Usage**        | Keys are used for encryption, decryption, signing, or verification         |
| **6. Key Rotation**     | Keys are periodically updated to limit exposure                            |
| **7. Key Revocation**   | Compromised or expired keys are invalidated                                |
| **8. Key Destruction**  | Secure erasure of keys no longer needed (e.g., zeroization)                |

## üîê Data States & Encryption

| Data State         | Encryption Focus                         | Common Techniques                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **At Rest**         | Stored on disk/drives/databases           | AES, file/folder encryption        |
| **In Transit**      | Moving across networks                    | TLS, IPsec, HTTPS                  |
| **In Use**          | Being processed by applications           | Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) |

## üß∞ Key Management Practices

| Practice                    | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Separation of Duties**     | Limit access to keys through role-based controls                    |
| **Centralized Management**  | Use tools like KMS, HSM, Vault                                     |
| **Auditing & Logging**       | Monitor key access and operations for compliance                   |
| **Automated Expiry/Rotation**| Avoid long-term exposure by rotating keys automatically            |
| **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** | Tamper-resistant devices for key storage and cryptographic operations |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Threats in the Encryption Lifecycle

| Threat                      | Mitigation Strategy                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Weak Key Generation**      | Use strong random sources and tested algorithms           |
| **Poor Key Storage**         | Use encrypted storage or HSMs, never store keys with data |
| **Leaked Keys**              | Rotate keys, revoke access immediately                    |
| **Broken Algorithms**        | Stay updated on cryptographic standards                   |
| **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**| Enforce TLS/PKI and certificate pinning                   |
