**Content filtering** is a security mechanism used to restrict or control the content a user can access over the web, email, or internal systems. It helps enforce organizational policies, reduce risk exposure, and protect against malicious or inappropriate content.

## 🎯 Purpose of Content Filtering

- 🚫 Block access to harmful or non-business-related websites
- 🛡️ Prevent malware, phishing, and spyware infections
- 🧑‍⚖️ Enforce acceptable use policies (AUP)
- ✅ Support compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., CIPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

| **Email Filtering**     | Filters spam, phishing, and malicious attachments          | Anti-spam filters, phishing detection |
| **Application Filtering** | Blocks specific applications or protocols                | Peer-to-peer (P2P), unauthorized VPNs |
| **Keyword Filtering**   | Scans and blocks traffic containing specific keywords       | Block messages with profanity         |

## 🧠 How Content Filtering Works

- 🌐 **DNS-level filtering**: Blocks domain names before connections are made
- 🔍 **Proxy-based filtering**: Intercepts and inspects HTTP/S traffic
- 📥 **Email filtering gateways**: Analyze message headers, links, attachments
- 🧬 **DLP integration**: Filters content based on sensitivity or classification
