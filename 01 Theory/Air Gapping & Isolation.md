**Air gapping** is a security technique that involves **physically or logically isolating a system or network** from any untrusted or public network, especially the internet. It’s commonly used in **critical infrastructure**, **classified systems**, and **high-assurance environments** to **prevent external threats, data leakage, and remote access**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Air Gapping

- 🔐 Prevent **external cyber threats** from reaching sensitive systems
- 🚫 Block **data exfiltration** via network-based channels
- 🛡️ Enforce **physical security** and **network segmentation**
- 🎯 Comply with **national security, industrial, or defense regulations**

## 🧱 Types of Isolation

| Type                   | Description                                              | Use Case                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Physical Air Gap**   | No network connection—completely disconnected            | Nuclear control systems, SCADA      |
| **Logical Air Gap**    | Separated by firewalls, proxies, or VLANs with controls  | Secure enclaves, internal dev nets  |
| **Unidirectional Gateway (Data Diode)** | Allows data flow in one direction only      | Export-only systems (e.g., sensor logs) |
| **Jump Server Isolation** | Controlled access via intermediary systems            | Admin access to secure zones        |

## 🛡️ Use Cases

- 🏭 **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)** / **SCADA**
- 🧬 **Research labs** with classified or sensitive IP
- 💼 **Financial systems** requiring regulatory compliance
- 🛡 **Government / Defense networks** (e.g., SIPRNet, JWICS)
- 🔐 **Cold wallets** for cryptocurrency storage

---

## 🔐 Security Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates risk of **remote attack vectors**
- ✅ Prevents **internet-based malware and exploits**
- ✅ Enables **manual control over data transfers**
- ✅ Simplifies **compliance with strict standards**

## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations

| Risk / Limitation             | Mitigation Strategy                             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Insider Threats**           | Use MFA, physical controls, strict RBAC          |
| **Removable Media Malware**   | Enforce scanning on USBs/CDs, restrict ports     |
| **Manual Data Transfer Errors**| Use checksums, signing, manual validation        |
| **Operational Overhead**      | Automate via secure file transfer protocols      |
| **Physical Breach**           | Lock hardware in secured facilities              |

## 🧰 Air Gap Enforcement Techniques

- 🔌 **Remove all NICs and Wi-Fi radios**
- 🔐 Disable unused I/O ports in BIOS/UEFI
- 🔒 Enforce USB restrictions (software and hardware level)
- 📦 Use **write-once removable media** (WORM DVDs, SD cards)
- ⚙️ Configure **one-way transfer mechanisms** using data diodes
- 🧾 Maintain detailed logs for all data ingress/egress

---

## 🧪 Examples in the Real World

- 🦠 **Stuxnet** (2010): Malware crossed air-gapped systems via USB
- 🔐 **Cold storage** in crypto: Offline wallets protected from theft
- 🛑 **Critical Infrastructure**: Power plants, chemical plants, defense networks

---

## 🧠 Air Gap ≠ 100% Security

Even air-gapped systems are vulnerable to:

- Insider compromise
- Covert channel attacks (e.g., acoustic, optical, EM emissions)
- Human error or policy violation

> 📌 Defense-in-depth should complement air gapping with **physical**, **technical**, and **administrative** controls.
