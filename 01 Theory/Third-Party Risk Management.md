**Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** is the practice of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating **risks posed by external entities** such as vendors, suppliers, contractors, cloud providers, and partners who have access to an organization‚Äôs systems, data, or infrastructure.

---

## üéØ Purpose of TPRM

- Protect against **supply chain compromise**
- Ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of systems
- Comply with **regulatory requirements** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST)
- Reduce business disruption from **third-party failures or breaches**
- Maintain visibility over **external attack surfaces**

## üß± Types of Third-Party Risks

| Risk Type         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cybersecurity**  | Weak or misconfigured third-party security controls                        |
| **Compliance**     | Vendor fails to meet regulatory or contract obligations                    |
| **Operational**    | Service outages or performance degradation                                 |
| **Financial**      | Vendor instability or bankruptcy                                           |
| **Reputational**   | Damage to brand due to third-party incidents                               |
| **Legal**          | Liability for breaches, data leaks, or contract violations                 |

## üîÅ Third-Party Risk Management Lifecycle

| Phase        | Activities                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identify** | Catalog vendors, classify by risk level, define business relationships     |
| **Assess**   | Evaluate security posture via questionnaires, audits, certifications       |
| **Onboard**  | Establish SLAs, security controls, and contracts                           |
| **Monitor**  | Ongoing reviews, threat monitoring, compliance checks                      |
| **Offboard** | Revoke access, remove credentials, ensure data disposition                 |

## üõ°Ô∏è Key TPRM Best Practices

- Maintain a **Vendor Inventory** with data access levels
- Use **risk tiers** (e.g., critical, moderate, low) for classification
- Require **security questionnaires** (e.g., SIG, CAIQ)
- Request **SOC 2, ISO 27001, or penetration test reports**
- Enforce **least privilege access** for external parties
- Monitor **third-party activity logs** and remote access
- Include **security clauses** in vendor contracts:
  - Incident reporting timelines
  - Right to audit
  - Data retention and deletion terms

## üß† Example: Risk Tiering

| Tier     | Criteria                              | Requirements                        |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Tier 1   | Has access to PII/PHI, production data | Full security audit, contract terms |
| Tier 2   | Supports internal services             | Security questionnaire, NDA         |
| Tier 3   | Indirect or no access to data         | Basic due diligence                  |
