**DevSecOps** integrates security into every phase of the DevOps lifecycle, ensuring that software is developed, delivered, and deployed with **security as a shared responsibility**. It enables faster, safer delivery of code by embedding security checks and controls into CI/CD workflows.

---

## 🎯 Goals of DevSecOps

- 🔒 Build **security into development**, not bolt it on afterward
- 🧠 **Empower developers** to write secure code
- ⚙️ Automate security checks in the CI/CD pipeline
- 🔁 Enable **continuous security assurance**

## 🧱 Key Principles

| Principle                 | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Shift Left**            | Implement security early in development (e.g., during code and design). |
| **Automation**            | Embed automated tests and scans in the CI/CD pipeline. |
| **Collaboration**         | Developers, security, and ops teams share responsibility for security. |
| **Security as Code**      | Treat security policies and configurations as version-controlled code. |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Real-time threat detection across the pipeline and runtime environments. |

## 🔁 DevSecOps in the SDLC

| SDLC Phase     | Security Practice |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Plan**        | Threat modeling, secure design reviews |
| **Develop**     | Static code analysis, secure coding standards |
| **Build**       | Dependency scanning (SCA), linting |
| **Test**        | DAST, SAST, IAST integration |
| **Release**     | Pre-deployment validation, policy enforcement |
| **Deploy**      | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning, container hardening |
| **Operate**     | Runtime security, SIEM integration, patch management |
| **Monitor**     | Log analysis, anomaly detection, alerting |

## 🧰 Common DevSecOps Tools

| Function                  | Tools |
|---------------------------|-------|
| **Code Analysis (SAST)**  | SonarQube, Checkmarx, CodeQL |
| **Dependency Scanning**   | Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, WhiteSource |
| **DAST**                  | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix |
| **Container Security**    | Aqua, Twistlock, Trivy |
| **IaC Scanning**          | Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan |
| **CI/CD Integration**     | Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions |
| **Secrets Detection**     | GitLeaks, TruffleHog |
| **Monitoring**            | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Splunk |

## 📈 Benefits of DevSecOps

- 🛡 Early detection of vulnerabilities
- 🚀 Faster, safer releases
- 📉 Reduced cost of fixing security issues
- ⚖️ Improved compliance posture
- 🤝 Better collaboration across teams

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- 🧑‍💻 Requires upskilling devs in security
- 🛠 Tool integration and orchestration can be complex
- 💬 May introduce cultural resistance to change
- 🧪 Need to balance speed vs security rigor

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- 📚 Train devs in secure coding and OWASP Top 10
- 🔄 Automate everything: tests, approvals, rollbacks
- 🧪 Test early and often (shift-left security testing)
- 🧰 Use IaC and version control for infrastructure security
- 📊 Monitor metrics like MTTD and MTTR (detection/response times)
