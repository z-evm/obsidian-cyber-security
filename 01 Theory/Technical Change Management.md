**Technical Change Management** refers to the **structured process of planning, implementing, and controlling technical changes** to IT infrastructure, software, hardware, and configurations, with minimal disruption and maximum accountability.

It emphasizes **stability, traceability, and control** over system and infrastructure-level changes.

## 🎯 Purpose

> **Technical Change Management answers the question:**  
> _"How do we introduce technical changes securely and systematically?"_

Goals:
- Prevent downtime or security issues due to improper changes
- Ensure proper **testing, documentation, and rollback planning**
- Reduce **human error** through controlled automation
- Maintain an **audit trail** of changes for compliance and review

## 🧱 Technical Change Scope

| Change Category        | Examples                                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Configuration** | Registry changes, kernel parameters, server settings     |
| **Software Updates**     | Patches, application upgrades, new software deployments |
| **Network Changes**      | Firewall rule updates, routing changes, DNS edits       |
| **Access Control Changes**| IAM roles, group membership, ACLs                      |
| **Infrastructure Changes**| VM deployments, provisioning storage, container updates|
| **DevOps / CI/CD**       | Pipeline changes, version control, environment configs  |

## 🔄 Technical Change Lifecycle

1. **Change Proposal** – Developer or admin submits a technical change request
2. **Impact Analysis** – Assess business, performance, and security impact
3. **Testing & Validation** – Test in non-prod environment (staging/lab)
4. **Approval** – Technical Change Manager or CAB review
5. **Scheduled Implementation** – Planned during approved change window
6. **Monitoring & Rollback** – Monitor for issues; rollback if needed
7. **Documentation & Closure** – Log changes and lessons learned

## 🛡 Technical Risk Considerations

| Risk Type            | Example                                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Risk**      | Firewall rule accidentally exposing public services       |
| **Availability Risk**  | OS patch crashes production VM                            |
| **Compliance Risk**    | Bypassing encryption settings during upgrade              |
| **Operational Risk**   | Changing DNS record without propagation check            |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **automated deployment** tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, GitOps)
- Maintain a **version-controlled change log**
- Implement **Change Freeze Windows** before audits or holidays
- Test rollback procedures **before** change deployment
- Tie changes to **ticketing systems** for traceability (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)
- Ensure **multi-team sign-off** for shared infrastructure changes

## 🧰 Tools for Technical Change Control

| Tool                 | Purpose                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Git**               | Source control and change tracking                 |
| **Ansible/Puppet/Chef**| Automated configuration changes                    |
| **Terraform**         | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud environments|
| **CI/CD Pipelines**   | Automated testing and deployment (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins) |
| **CMDBs**             | Maintain configuration state and dependencies      |
| **SIEM Integration**  | Monitor changes for security events                |
