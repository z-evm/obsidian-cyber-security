**Hardware Security** refers to physical and embedded protections designed to safeguard computing systems, devices, and their data from tampering, unauthorized access, theft, and exploitation at the hardware level.

It encompasses secure system design, tamper resistance, firmware validation, and trusted execution environments.

## üéØ Objectives of Hardware Security

- Prevent **physical tampering** and data theft
- Ensure **device integrity** from boot through runtime
- Enable **secure storage and key protection**
- Support cryptographic operations with **trusted hardware**
- Mitigate threats like **firmware attacks**, **hardware implants**, and **supply chain compromises**

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- Enable **Secure Boot** and **TPM-based protection**
- Regularly update BIOS/UEFI from trusted sources
- Use **drive encryption** with hardware-based key storage
- Implement **physical security controls** (locks, access restrictions)
- Disable or restrict **unused ports** (e.g., USB, FireWire)
- Validate hardware from **trusted suppliers** only
