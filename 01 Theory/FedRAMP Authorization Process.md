The **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** provides a standardized approach for assessing, authorizing, and continuously monitoring the security of cloud products and services used by U.S. federal agencies.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure **cloud security and compliance** for federal agencies.
- Provide **reusable authorizations** to reduce redundant assessments.
- Promote **trust, transparency**, and **risk-based governance** in cloud services.
- Align with **FISMA**, **OMB A-130**, and **NIST RMF** requirements.

## üß≠ Authorization Paths

| Path                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JAB P-ATO**             | Provisional ATO by Joint Authorization Board (DoD, DHS, GSA). High rigor.   |
| **Agency ATO**            | Authorization granted by an individual agency. More common/flexible.       |
| **FedRAMP Tailored**      | Streamlined path for Low-Impact SaaS (Li-SaaS) providers.                  |

---

## üîÅ FedRAMP Authorization Lifecycle

### 1. **Preparation**

- Determine **impact level**: Low / Moderate / High (based on FIPS 199).
- Align with **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** security controls.
- Engage a **FedRAMP-accredited 3PAO** (Third-Party Assessment Organization).
- Develop initial documentation:
  - [[System Security Plan (SSP)]]
  - [[Continuous Monitoring Plan]]
  - Incident Response Plan
  - Configuration Management Plan

---

### 2. **Security Assessment**

- 3PAO conducts **independent testing** of security controls.
- Generate key artifacts:
  - [[Security Assessment Plan (SAP)]]
  - [[Security Assessment Report (SAR)]]
  - [[Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)]]
- Validate findings and fix high-risk vulnerabilities.

---

### 3. **Authorization Package Submission**

- Submit complete **security authorization package** to:
  - The sponsoring **Agency AO** (for Agency ATO).
  - The **JAB reviewers** (for JAB P-ATO).
- Package includes:
  - SSP, SAR, POA&M, SAP, policies, procedures, contingency plans.

---

### 4. **Authorization Decision**

| Outcome           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ATO Granted**    | Risk is acceptable; CSP is listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace.              |
| **ATO Denied**     | Risk too high; CSP must remediate and resubmit.                            |
| **P-ATO Granted**  | JAB grants provisional authorization, allowing reuse across agencies.       |

---

### 5. **Continuous Monitoring**

- Monthly:
  - Vulnerability scans (internal, external, web apps)
  - POA&M updates
  - Incident reporting (within 1 hour of major events)
- Annually:
  - Control reassessments
  - 3PAO audit reports
- Maintain authorization status and respond to new threats.

## üì¶ Required Documentation Summary

| Artifact                      | Purpose                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Security Plan (SSP)** | Documents control implementation and system architecture.     |
| **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** | Technical testing results by 3PAO.                        |
| **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** | Tracks mitigation of weaknesses.                  |
| **Security Assessment Plan (SAP)** | Methodology and scope of testing.                          |
| **Continuous Monitoring Plan** | Describes post-authorization monitoring activities.           |

---

## üìö Control Baselines

| Impact Level | Controls (NIST SP 800-53) | Typical Use Case                           |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | ~125 controls              | Public-facing, non-sensitive SaaS apps      |
| **Moderate** | ~325 controls              | Internal collaboration, PII, business data  |
| **High**     | ~421 controls              | Law enforcement, healthcare, national security |

## üîê Key Roles

| Role                      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** | Organization seeking FedRAMP authorization.                         |
| **Authorizing Official (AO)**     | Federal agency or JAB official granting the ATO.                    |
| **Third-Party Assessment Org (3PAO)** | Conducts security assessments.                                  |
| **FedRAMP PMO**           | Provides governance, guidance, and oversight.                              |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use FedRAMP templates from [https://fedramp.gov/documents](https://fedramp.gov/documents)
- Begin with an internal **readiness assessment** before 3PAO engagement.
- Monitor and remediate vulnerabilities **proactively**.
- Leverage the **Marketplace** to reuse existing authorizations.
