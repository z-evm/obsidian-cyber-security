**GAP Analysis** in cybersecurity is a structured process used to identify the **difference ("gap") between current security posture and desired or required security standards**. It is often conducted as part of compliance, risk management, or continuous improvement efforts.

## üéØ Purpose

> **GAP Analysis answers the question:**  
> _"Where are we now, and where should we be?"_

It helps organizations:
- Identify **missing controls**
- Highlight **compliance deficiencies**
- Prioritize **remediation efforts**
- Improve **security posture**

## üß± GAP Analysis Process

| Step                      | Description                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Define Scope**        | Determine systems, departments, or standards to evaluate          |
| **2. Establish Criteria**  | Use frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or CIS Controls               |
| **3. Assess Current State**| Conduct audits, interviews, and technical reviews                 |
| **4. Identify Gaps**       | Compare current controls to required controls                     |
| **5. Prioritize Gaps**     | Rank gaps by risk, impact, or compliance urgency                  |
| **6. Report Findings**     | Document issues, root causes, and proposed actions                |
| **7. Develop Action Plan** | Create roadmap for remediation and ongoing improvement            |

## üì¶ Common Use Cases

| Use Case                           | Example                                                   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compliance**                     | Check alignment with NIST 800-53, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.     |
| **Maturity Assessments**           | Measure security maturity using CIS Controls               |
| **Incident Preparedness**          | Evaluate response plans against NIST SP 800-61             |
| **Vendor Risk Management**         | Assess third-party compliance to internal standards        |
| **Cloud Security Posture Review**  | Compare cloud configs to CIS AWS or Azure benchmarks       |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Gaps Found

| Category               | Example Gap                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technical Controls** | Missing MFA, outdated TLS versions                          |
| **Policy Gaps**        | No formal incident response plan                            |
| **Monitoring**         | Incomplete logging or no SIEM correlation                   |
| **Training**           | Lack of regular security awareness training                 |
| **Asset Management**   | Shadow IT or untracked devices                              |
