**Unified Threat Management (UTM)** is a security solution that **bundles multiple security functions into a single appliance** or software platform. UTM devices are designed for **simplified security administration**, especially in **small to medium-sized networks**.

---

## üéØ Goals of UTM

- Provide **broad-spectrum protection** using a centralized solution.
- Reduce complexity and cost by combining multiple security layers.
- Enable easier policy management and threat visibility.

## üß± Core UTM Components

| Security Function          | Description                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Firewall**               | Controls traffic using stateful inspection and rule sets        |
| **IPS/IDS**                | Detects and/or blocks known attack signatures                   |
| **Antivirus/Antimalware**  | Scans inbound/outbound files and web content                   |
| **Web Content Filtering**  | Blocks harmful or inappropriate websites                        |
| **Email Security**         | Filters spam, malware, and phishing attempts                    |
| **VPN**                    | Secures remote and site-to-site connections                     |
| **Application Control**    | Regulates the use of cloud/SaaS applications                    |
| **Logging & Reporting**    | Centralized logging for security visibility and compliance      |
