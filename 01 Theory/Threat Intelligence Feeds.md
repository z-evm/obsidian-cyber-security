**Threat Intelligence Feeds** are real-time or regularly updated streams of **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**, threat actor profiles, malware signatures, vulnerabilities, and TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures). These feeds help defenders proactively detect, block, and respond to evolving cyber threats.

Feeds may be **commercial**, **open-source**, or **community-driven**, and are often integrated into **SIEM**, **EDR**, **firewalls**, and **SOAR** platforms.

## üéØ Purpose of Threat Feeds

- Enhance **threat detection** and **prevention**
- Inform **incident response** with relevant context
- Enrich SIEM/EDR alerts with **external threat data**
- Prioritize vulnerabilities and patching based on exploitation in the wild
- Feed into **threat hunting**, **IOC correlation**, and **threat modeling**

## üß† Types of Threat Intelligence Feeds

| Feed Type            | Description                                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IP Reputation**     | Known malicious or suspicious IPs (e.g., botnets, C2s)            |
| **Domain/URL Blacklists** | Phishing domains, malware delivery infrastructure             |
| **File Hashes**       | MD5/SHA1/SHA256 for known malware or droppers                    |
| **YARA/Snort Rules**  | Detection rules for malware families or exploits                  |
| **Vulnerability Intelligence** | CVEs actively exploited in the wild                      |
| **Threat Actor Profiles** | Attribution, TTPs, malware families, and infrastructure      |

| **Firewall / IDS/IPS** | Use Snort, Suricata, or IP blacklists for real-time blocking|
| **EDR/XDR Platforms**  | Threat enrichment and automated response                     |
| **SOAR**               | Automate actions on detection (e.g., block IP, isolate host) |
| **TIP (Threat Intel Platform)** | Centralize feed management (e.g., MISP, Anomali)     |

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- Use a **mix of sources** (commercial + open-source)
- Apply **confidence scores** and **false-positive filtering**
- Normalize feeds using STIX/TAXII where possible
- Enable **auto-ingestion** into detection tools
- Avoid alert fatigue by **curating only relevant feeds**

## üìö IOC Formats Common in Feeds

| Format     | Purpose                                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression)** | Machine-readable threat data model |
| **TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information)** | Feed transport protocol |
| **CSV / JSON / XML** | Simple feed formats for manual or scripted ingestion |
| **Sigma / YARA / Suricata Rules** | Detection signatures for automated deployment |
