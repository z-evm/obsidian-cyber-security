**Configuration Management (CM)** is the structured process of **establishing, maintaining, and documenting the integrity of system settings**, software versions, and hardware configurations over time.

It ensures systems remain secure, consistent, and **aligned with organizational policies and security baselines**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Configuration Management answers the question:**  
> _"Are our systems configured correctly, consistently, and securely?"_

Goals:
- Enforce **secure baselines**
- Prevent **misconfiguration-based vulnerabilities**
- Track and control system changes
- Enable quick recovery from unintended changes or breaches

## üß± Core Components

| Component                 | Description                                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Configuration Baselines** | Predefined, approved system settings (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)|
| **Configuration Items (CIs)**| Elements managed (e.g., OS, apps, network settings)      |
| **Change Control**         | Formal review and approval before making changes           |
| **Version Control**        | Track versions of software, files, configurations          |
| **Configuration Auditing** | Compare current state to expected baseline                 |

## üîÅ Configuration Management Lifecycle

1. **Define**: Create secure baseline configurations
2. **Implement**: Apply settings using automated tools
3. **Monitor**: Continuously check for drift or unauthorized changes
4. **Audit**: Validate current configuration against the baseline
5. **Update**: Adjust configurations to adapt to new risks or requirements

| **Application**     | Logging level, update frequency           |
| **Network**         | Port access, ACLs, SNMP settings          |
| **Database**        | Encryption settings, query logging        |
| **User Access**     | Password policies, MFA enforcement        |

## üîê Configuration Management & Security

Misconfigurations are one of the most common security weaknesses.

Examples of high-risk misconfigs:
- Open S3 buckets or exposed storage
- Default credentials left active
- RDP enabled without MFA or VPN
- Unused services left running

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Apply **secure baseline configurations** (e.g., CIS, DISA STIGs)
- Automate deployment of configurations (IaC)
- Enforce **change control** and rollback planning
- Continuously monitor for **configuration drift**
- Perform regular **audits and compliance scans**
- Document and version all configuration changes

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges

- Shadow IT or undocumented assets
- Manual configuration errors
- Lack of rollback or version tracking
- No visibility into drift or change over time
