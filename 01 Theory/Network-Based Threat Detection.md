**Network-Based Threat Detection** refers to the process of identifying malicious or suspicious activity by monitoring and analyzing **network traffic**. It plays a critical role in detecting threats like **malware**, **C2 communications**, **intrusions**, and **data exfiltration**‚Äîoften before endpoint compromise is fully evident.

This detection layer complements endpoint and behavioral analytics in a **defense-in-depth** strategy.

## üéØ Purpose of Network-Based Detection

- Monitor **north-south and east-west** traffic for anomalies
- Detect **external attacks**, **lateral movement**, and **C2 communication**
- Uncover **policy violations**, **suspicious protocols**, or **data leakage**
- Provide **forensic data** for incident response and threat hunting

## üß† Key Detection Methods

| Method                      | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Signature-based**          | Detects known attack patterns (e.g., Snort rules, CVE exploits)   |
| **Anomaly-based**            | Detects deviations from traffic baselines (volume, timing, ports) |
| **Heuristic/Behavioral**     | Uses rules or AI to flag suspicious protocol usage or flows       |
| **Threat Intelligence Matching** | Correlates IPs, domains, URLs with known IOCs             |
| **Statistical Profiling**    | Identifies beaconing, slow scans, or brute force attempts         |

## üìä Sample Use Cases

- Detect **DNS tunneling** using entropy and query analysis
- Identify **C2 beaconing** through time-based traffic patterns
- Flag **unauthorized protocol use** (e.g., FTP over unusual ports)
- Reveal **port scanning** and stealthy enumeration attempts
- Correlate NetFlow with endpoint alerts to verify real threats

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- High data volume requires **scalable infrastructure**
- Encryption (e.g., HTTPS) limits visibility unless inspected
- False positives from misconfigured services or apps
- Requires **skilled analysts** and constant tuning
