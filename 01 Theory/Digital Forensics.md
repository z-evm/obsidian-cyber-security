**Digital Forensics** is the science of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legally admissible. It plays a critical role in incident response, litigation, and cybersecurity investigations.

---

## üéØ Objectives of Digital Forensics

- Identify the **cause**, **impact**, and **origin** of security incidents.
- Preserve the **integrity** and **chain of custody** of digital evidence.
- Assist in **legal proceedings** or internal investigations.
- Recover **deleted, encrypted, or hidden data**.

## üß¨ Forensic Process Lifecycle

| Phase                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Identification**| Detect incident, define scope, identify affected systems                     |
| **2. Preservation**  | Isolate systems, ensure evidence is not modified (write-blockers, snapshots)|
| **3. Collection**    | Acquire bit-level copies, logs, memory dumps, disk images                   |
| **4. Examination**   | Extract, recover, and review data (keywords, timestamps, anomalies)         |
| **5. Analysis**      | Correlate artifacts, reconstruct timeline, identify attacker techniques      |
| **6. Reporting**     | Document findings, maintain evidence integrity, present clearly to stakeholders |
| **7. Presentation**  | Provide testimony or formal report in court or corporate settings           |

## üîê Key Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chain of Custody**      | Documentation of who handled evidence, when, and how                        |
| **Integrity Preservation**| Use of hashes (e.g., SHA-256) to validate data was not altered              |
| **Repeatability**         | Methods should be reproducible by other investigators                      |
| **Minimal Handling**      | Avoid interacting with live evidence unless necessary                      |

## üíª Types of Digital Evidence

| Type               | Examples                                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Volatile Data**   | RAM, running processes, network connections, temp files               |
| **Non-volatile Data**| Hard drives, SSDs, logs, metadata, emails, system configs           |
| **Network Evidence**| Packet captures, proxy logs, firewall logs                           |
| **Cloud Artifacts** | Access logs, object metadata, SaaS activity logs                     |
| **Mobile Evidence** | App data, SMS, GPS, device backups                                   |

## üõ° Incident Response vs Forensics

| Aspect            | Incident Response                        | Digital Forensics                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**          | Contain and recover from an incident     | Investigate and gather legally-sound evidence |
| **Speed**         | Prioritizes rapid action                 | Prioritizes thoroughness and documentation    |
| **Scope**         | Operational impact mitigation            | Legal, root cause, long-term evidence         |

## ‚öñ Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Authorization**: Ensure explicit consent or warrants before investigation.
- **Privacy Laws**: Respect data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Admissibility**: Use sound methodology to ensure evidence is court-admissible.
- **Documentation**: Every step must be logged and justifiable.
