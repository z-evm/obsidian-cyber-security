**EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)** and **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** are modern cybersecurity solutions aimed at threat detection, investigation, and automated response. XDR extends EDR capabilities beyond the endpoint.

## üéØ Quick Definitions

| Term  | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **EDR** | Focused on detecting and responding to threats at the **endpoint level** (e.g., laptops, servers). |
| **XDR** | An evolution of EDR that **integrates telemetry** from **endpoints, network, email, cloud**, and more. |

## üß± Key Differences

| Feature                      | EDR                                | XDR                                                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                    | Endpoints only                      | Endpoints + Network + Email + Cloud + Identity     |
| **Data Sources**             | OS logs, process data               | Unified telemetry from multiple sources            |
| **Visibility**               | Device-level                        | Environment-wide                                   |
| **Threat Correlation**       | Endpoint-only                       | Multi-vector correlation & detection               |
| **Response Automation**      | Limited to endpoint                 | Cross-layer response orchestration                 |
| **Tool Consolidation**       | Requires integration with other tools| Built-in multi-domain integration                  |
| **Complexity**               | Easier to deploy/manage             | May require more initial setup and tuning          |

| Area                     | EDR Capabilities                     | XDR Enhancements                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Detection**            | Detects threats on local machines    | Correlates cross-platform threats in real-time    |
| **Containment**          | Quarantines or isolates endpoints    | Also blocks network traffic, email threats, etc.  |
| **Investigation**        | Focused timeline for a single host   | Full kill-chain visibility across attack surface  |
| **Response**             | Manual/semi-automated                | More contextual and automated                     |
