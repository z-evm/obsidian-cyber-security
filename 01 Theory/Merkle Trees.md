> A cryptographic data structure used to efficiently verify and secure the contents of large datasets, such as blockchain transactions.

## 📌 What Is a Merkle Tree?

- A **binary tree** of **cryptographic hashes**.
- Each **leaf node** contains the hash of a data block (e.g., a transaction).
- Each **non-leaf (parent)** node contains the hash of its two child nodes.
- The top node is called the **Merkle Root** — a single hash representing the entire data set.

## 🧠 Purpose in Blockchain

| Function                 | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Efficient verification** | Proves inclusion of data (transaction) with minimal information            |
| **Data integrity**        | Any tampering changes the Merkle Root, alerting the network                 |
| **Compact proofs**        | Enables light clients to verify transactions without full blockchain copy   |
| **Scalability**           | Allows large sets of transactions to be verified and managed efficiently    |

## 🧱 Merkle Tree Structure

**Example with 4 transactions (T1–T4):**
```
Hash1 Hash2 Hash3 Hash4
```


- **Hash1 = H(T1)**, **Hash2 = H(T2)**, etc.
- **Hash12 = H(Hash1 + Hash2)**

## 🔐 Cryptographic Role

| Aspect                 | Application in Merkle Trees                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hashing**            | Used to combine and verify data recursively                   |
| **Tamper Detection**   | Even a single bit change causes root hash to differ           |
| **Authentication**     | Verifiable with Merkle proofs (subset of hashes)              |
| **Proof-of-Inclusion** | Provides assurance that data is part of the full set          |

## 🧪 Merkle Proofs (Inclusion Proofs)

- To prove a transaction is in a block, only a small number of sibling hashes are needed.
- Used in **Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)** clients.
- Reduces the amount of data needed to verify block contents.

## 📚 Blockchain Use Cases

| Use Case                  | Role of Merkle Trees                                             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bitcoin**               | Each block contains a Merkle Root of all transactions            |
| **Ethereum**              | Uses multiple Merkle Patricia Trees (for state, transactions, receipts) |
| **SPV Clients**           | Use Merkle proofs to verify inclusion without full node sync     |
| **IPFS & DLTs**           | Leverage Merkle DAGs to track and verify content                 |

## 🧮 Merkle Root & Block Header

- Stored in the **block header**.
- Used in **Proof of Work (PoW)** mining — the Merkle Root is hashed along with nonce and other fields.
- Any change to a transaction invalidates the Merkle Root → new mining effort required.
