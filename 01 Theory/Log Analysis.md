**Log Analysis** is the process of reviewing, interpreting, and correlating log data generated by systems, applications, devices, and networks to detect anomalies, investigate incidents, and ensure compliance.

It forms the backbone of **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **compliance auditing** in security operations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Identify unauthorized access or suspicious behavior
- Monitor for signs of compromise or policy violations
- Support forensic investigations and root cause analysis
- Aid in compliance with regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX)
- Provide operational visibility across systems

## üì¶ Common Log Types

| Log Type              | Description                                                  | Source Examples                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **System Logs**        | OS-level events, shutdowns, driver issues                   | `/var/log/syslog`, Event Viewer        |
| **Authentication Logs**| Successful/failed logins, account lockouts                  | `/var/log/auth.log`, Windows Security Log |
| **Application Logs**   | Events generated by apps or services                        | Web servers, DB logs, AV logs          |
| **Network Logs**       | Traffic flows, blocked packets, connection attempts         | Firewalls, routers, switches           |
| **Security Logs**      | IDS/IPS alerts, policy violations, malware activity         | Snort, Suricata, EDRs                  |
| **Audit Logs**         | Changes to permissions, objects, and sensitive actions      | File servers, IAM systems              |
| **Web/Proxy Logs**     | URL requests, status codes, browsing patterns               | Apache, Nginx, Squid Proxy             |
| **Cloud Logs**         | Resource usage, access logs, API calls                      | AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor          |

## üîç Key Techniques

| Technique             | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Keyword Matching**   | Search for specific strings (e.g., ‚ÄúFailed login‚Äù, ‚ÄúDROP packet‚Äù)      |
| **Pattern Recognition**| Detect regex or known malicious indicators                            |
| **Anomaly Detection**  | Identify deviations from baselines or statistical norms               |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Link related events across different log sources                    |
| **Timeline Reconstruction** | Sequence events chronologically for incident investigation       |
| **Frequency Analysis** | Detect brute-force or DDoS via volume-based patterns                  |

## üß™ Indicators to Watch For

- Repeated failed logins (e.g., brute force)
- Unexpected privilege escalation (e.g., user ‚Üí root/admin)
- Unusual network ports or external connections
- Execution of LOLBins or PowerShell scripts
- Logins from geographies inconsistent with user behavior
- Unauthorized changes to registry, services, or binaries

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

| Practice                     | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Centralize logs**          | Use a SIEM or syslog server to collect logs in one place     |
| **Time-sync systems**        | Ensure NTP is configured for accurate log correlation         |
| **Use retention policies**   | Maintain logs as per regulatory or operational requirements   |
| **Filter noise**             | Remove low-value events to reduce alert fatigue               |
| **Establish baselines**      | Understand what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looks like for effective anomaly detection |
| **Review regularly**         | Automate alerts but also perform manual review during audits  |

## üß∑ Compliance & Forensics

- **Chain of custody**: Preserve original logs for evidence
- **Log integrity**: Use hashing or WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage
- **Access control**: Restrict who can view or alter logs
- **Retention**: Keep logs for mandated durations (e.g., 90 days, 1 year)
