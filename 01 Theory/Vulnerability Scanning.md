**Vulnerability scanning** is the process of **automatically identifying known security weaknesses** in systems, networks, applications, and devices. It plays a critical role in proactive defense and risk management strategies.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Vulnerability Scanning

- Detect **known vulnerabilities** (e.g., missing patches, misconfigurations)
- Assist in **risk assessment and prioritization**
- Maintain **compliance** with standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001)
- Provide input for **remediation plans**

> 🧠 Vulnerability scanning ≠ penetration testing. Scanning is passive and broad; pentesting is active and targeted.

## 🧱 Types of Vulnerability Scans

| Type                    | Description                                             | Example Use Case                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Network-based**        | Scans systems via open ports, services, and protocols  | Identify exposed SSH or SMB ports      |
| **Host-based**           | Local scan of OS, registry, file system                | Detect outdated software or weak config|
| **Application-based**    | Web or client app vulnerability scanning               | XSS, SQLi, insecure cookies             |
| **Credentialed**         | Uses admin creds for deeper scan                       | More accurate results; less false positives |
| **Non-credentialed**     | External-only scan, simulating attacker view           | Perimeter-focused discovery            |
| **Passive**              | Observes traffic to detect potential vulnerabilities   | No active probing, used for stealth    |
| **Active**               | Direct interaction with systems                        | Most common type                       |

---

## 🧪 Common Vulnerabilities Detected

- Outdated OS and software
- Default passwords or weak credentials
- Open ports and services
- SSL/TLS misconfigurations
- Insecure configurations (e.g., SMBv1, FTP anonymous access)
- Missing patches (CVE-based)

## ⚙️ Scanning Process Overview

1. 🔍 **Asset Discovery**
2. 🛠 **Scan Configuration**
   - Scope, scan type, credentials
3. 🧪 **Execution**
   - Scheduled or on-demand
4. 📊 **Analysis**
   - Identify, categorize, prioritize vulnerabilities (CVSS)
5. 🔄 **Remediation**
   - Patch, harden, or isolate affected assets
6. ✅ **Re-scan**
   - Verify that issues are resolved

---

## 📉 Risks and Limitations

- **False positives** and false negatives
- May trigger **intrusion detection alerts**
- Can cause **system instability** if misconfigured
- Doesn’t find **unknown (zero-day)** or logic flaws
- Needs **regular updates** (CVEs, signatures)

## ⚖️ Regulatory and Compliance Use

| Standard     | Use of Vulnerability Scanning                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **PCI-DSS**  | Requires quarterly external scans                      |
| **HIPAA**    | Mandates regular risk assessments                      |
| **ISO 27001**| Encourages routine technical vulnerability management  |
| **NIST 800-53**| Implements continuous monitoring controls            |
