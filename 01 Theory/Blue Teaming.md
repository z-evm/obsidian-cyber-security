**Blue Teaming** refers to the defensive side of cybersecurity — protecting an organization's systems, networks, and data from **cyberattacks** through continuous **monitoring, detection, response, and hardening**.

Blue Teams are responsible for **maintaining security posture**, identifying threats, and responding to incidents as they occur.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> **Blue Teaming answers the question:**  
> _"How do we detect, prevent, and respond to attacks?"_

Objectives:
- Monitor for abnormal behavior and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Detect and respond to attacks in real-time
- Strengthen defenses through continuous improvement
- Investigate incidents and prevent recurrence

## 🔁 Common Blue Team Activities

| Task                      | Example                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Monitoring**            | Detect abnormal PowerShell behavior in endpoints      |
| **Threat Hunting**        | Search for TTPs using MITRE ATT&CK framework           |
| **Log Analysis**          | Review login patterns and failed access attempts       |
| **Alert Triage**          | Investigate and escalate SIEM alerts                   |
| **Incident Response**     | Isolate infected hosts and contain spread              |
| **Control Validation**    | Test that alerts fire as expected (via Purple Teaming) |

## 📦 Key Blue Team Frameworks & Models

- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Maps adversary behavior to detection opportunities
- **NIST SP 800-61**: Incident handling guide
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: Framework to understand attack stages
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered security strategy

## 🛡 Best Practices

- Enable logging across all critical systems
- Continuously test detection rules and update playbooks
- Keep threat intelligence feeds current
- Conduct regular tabletop and incident response exercises
- Apply least privilege and network segmentation
- Use automation (SOAR) for rapid response and containment

---

## 🤝 Blue Team & Purple Team Collaboration

- Work closely with Red and Purple Teams to **simulate and test** realistic attacks
- Tune detections and improve response workflows using **real-time feedback**
- Conduct **gap analysis** based on missed detections or delayed responses
