**Social engineering** is the use of **psychological manipulation** to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering exploits **human behavior** rather than system vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Why Social Engineering Works

- Relies on **trust**, **urgency**, **fear**, or **curiosity**
- Exploits **lack of training**, **human error**, or **routine**
- Bypasses technical controls by targeting the **user directly**

## üß™ Social Engineering Red Flags

- Unusual sense of **urgency** ("Act now!")  
- **Unfamiliar senders** requesting sensitive data  
- Requests for **passwords or credentials**  
- Emails with **grammar mistakes** or generic greetings  
- **Spoofed** domains (e.g., paypa1.com vs paypal.com)
