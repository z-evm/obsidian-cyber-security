## üîÑ Hybrid and Evolving Threats

| Combination           | Description                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Ransomware + Worm**  | Spreads autonomously (e.g., WannaCry)               |
| **Trojan + Backdoor**  | Appears useful but installs remote control software |
| **Fileless + Ransomware** | Avoids detection, encrypts data                 |
