A **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** provides a comprehensive evaluation of an information system‚Äôs security posture. It details the effectiveness of security controls, identifies vulnerabilities, and supports risk-based decision-making in systems authorization processes (e.g., under **FISMA**, **FedRAMP**, **RMF**).

---

## üéØ Purpose of a SAR

- **Document control effectiveness** based on assessments.
- **Identify vulnerabilities** and deficiencies.
- **Support the Authorizing Official (AO)** in making risk-based decisions.
- Serve as a basis for creating a **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)**.

## üìã SAR Key Elements

| Section                         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Executive Summary**            | High-level overview of findings, system context, and key risks.            |
| **System Overview**              | Description of the system boundary, environment, and key components.       |
| **Assessment Methodology**       | Tools, techniques, and procedures used (e.g., interviews, scans, testing). |
| **Assessed Controls**            | List of evaluated security controls (NIST SP 800-53 or other frameworks).  |
| **Findings Summary**            | Results by control family: compliant, deficient, or partially implemented. |
| **Vulnerabilities Identified**   | Specific weaknesses found, often with CVSS scores or risk ratings.         |
| **Risk Impact Analysis**         | Describes business/mission impact of weaknesses.                           |
| **Recommendations**             | Suggested mitigation strategies or enhancements.                           |
| **Appendices**                  | Raw scan data, evidence, control testing notes, or supplemental info.      |

## üîç SAR in the NIST RMF Lifecycle

| RMF Step                     | SAR Role                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step 4: Assess**           | The SAR is created after control assessment by the security assessor.   |
| **Step 5: Authorize**        | Authorizing Official reviews SAR to determine residual risk.            |
| **Step 6: Monitor**          | Updates to SAR may occur during continuous monitoring or reauthorization.|

## üõ† Assessment Techniques Used

- **Interviews**
- **Document Review**
- **Configuration Analysis**
- **Vulnerability Scanning**
- **Penetration Testing**
- **Control Testing & Observation**

---

## üìö Common Frameworks Referenced

- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5**
- **FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework (SAF)**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**
- **CIS Controls**
- **FIPS 199 / 200**

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Map findings directly to **control IDs** (e.g., AC-2, SC-7).
- Rate each finding with **risk severity** (e.g., Low/Moderate/High).
- Include **evidence snapshots** for testing validation.
- Align with findings in the **POA&M** for traceability.
- Keep SAR **updated annually** or after major changes.
