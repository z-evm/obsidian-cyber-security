**Vulnerability Management** is the continuous process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and remediating **security weaknesses** in systems, software, and configurations.

It is essential to reducing **attack surface**, mitigating **exploitation risk**, and maintaining compliance with cybersecurity frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> **Vulnerability Management answers the question:**  
> _"Where are we exposed, and what are we doing about it?"_

Goals:
- Detect known vulnerabilities across environments
- Assess and prioritize risks
- Apply remediation or mitigation
- Track vulnerability status and remediation timelines

## 🔁 The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

| Phase             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Identification** | Scan systems for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)                       |
| **2. Evaluation**     | Determine risk based on CVSS, asset value, and exposure                   |
| **3. Prioritization** | Rank vulnerabilities by severity and business impact                      |
| **4. Remediation**     | Apply patches, config changes, or compensating controls                  |
| **5. Verification**    | Re-scan or test to confirm successful remediation                        |
| **6. Reporting**       | Document vulnerability status, trends, and unresolved items              |

## 🧰 Key Tools and Technologies

| Tool / Category           | Examples                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vulnerability Scanners** | Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 InsightVM, OpenVAS             |
| **Patch Management**       | WSUS, SCCM, ManageEngine                              |
| **Threat Intelligence Feeds** | CVE databases, NVD, CISA KEV, vendor advisories     |
| **Asset Inventory Systems** | Track what is being scanned and protected            |
| **SIEM Integration**       | Correlate vulnerabilities with detection logs         |

## 🧠 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

> An industry-standard method to evaluate the **severity** of vulnerabilities.

| Metric Type     | Examples                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Base Score**   | Inherent severity (e.g., CVSS 9.8 = Critical) |
| **Temporal**     | How the risk changes over time               |
| **Environmental**| Adjusted to local business impact            |

## 🔥 Real-World Examples

| Vulnerability                    | Risk & Remediation                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Unpatched Log4j (CVE-2021-44228)** | Remote code execution; patch or disable JNDI |
| **Outdated SSL/TLS**             | Enables MITM attacks; upgrade to TLS 1.2/1.3    |
| **Weak passwords on admin panel** | Brute force risk; enforce password policy       |

## 🛡 Best Practices

- Maintain **updated asset inventory**
- Schedule **regular vulnerability scans**
- Use **credentialed scans** for deeper visibility
- Integrate **threat intelligence** to prioritize emerging exploits
- Implement **patch management** and change control procedures
- Report and track using a **vulnerability register**

---

## ⚠️ Common Challenges

- Shadow IT and unmanaged assets
- Patch fatigue or operational constraints
- False positives/negatives in scan results
- Prioritization overload in large environments
- Compliance vs security trade-offs
