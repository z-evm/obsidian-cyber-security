When securing remote access to internal resources, two commonly used methods are **Bastion Hosts (Jump Servers)** and **VPN Access**. Both provide secure pathways into protected environments but differ in **architecture, security posture, and use cases**.

## üîÅ Quick Comparison

| Feature                      | **Bastion Host**                            | **VPN Access**                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Access Model**            | Access through a hardened intermediary host | Network tunnel to entire internal network    |
| **Granularity**             | Fine-grained, host-level access             | Broad access to network/subnet               |
| **Deployment**              | VM in DMZ or cloud public subnet            | VPN server or gateway appliance              |
| **User Experience**         | Requires SSH/RDP into jump server           | Seamless access to network apps/resources    |
| **Auditability**            | Easier to log/monitor sessions              | Session visibility depends on endpoint tools |
| **Attack Surface**          | Exposes only the jump host                  | VPN gateway exposed; wider lateral movement  |
| **Cloud-Native Integration**| Strong (e.g., AWS Bastion, Azure Bastion)   | Varies (needs VPN client, config, infra)     |
| **Best Use Case**           | Admin access to specific servers            | General user access to internal resources     |

## üß± What Is a Bastion Host?

- A **jump server** with public access that acts as a **gateway to private resources**.
- Accesses are typically via **SSH** (Linux) or **RDP** (Windows).
- Provides **tight access control, session logging**, and centralized monitoring.
- Often deployed in **cloud environments** for secure admin access.

### üîí Pros
- Least-privilege access to specific hosts.
- Supports full session auditing (keystrokes, screen).
- Reduces exposure of internal infrastructure.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons
- Requires user training or automation for usability.
- Single point of failure if not redundant.

---

## üåê What Is VPN Access?

- A **secure encrypted tunnel** from a client to the internal network.
- Uses protocols like **IPSec, SSL/TLS, WireGuard**.
- Typically allows access to **entire internal subnets**.

### üîí Pros
- Easy for end-users with VPN client software.
- Supports broad access to multiple internal systems.
- Ideal for remote workers or contractors needing full access.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons
- **Lateral movement risk** if endpoint is compromised.
- Harder to restrict session behavior or commands.
- Logging and segmentation require additional effort.

## üîê Security Considerations

| Area                | Bastion Host                                | VPN Access                                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege** | Easy to implement per-host access            | Needs NAC or subnet restrictions               |
| **Session Monitoring** | Full control (via PAM or screen recording) | Requires endpoint telemetry or SIEM integration|
| **MFA Enforcement** | Simple to enforce (SSO, IAM policies)        | Depends on VPN client/provider support         |
| **Credential Exposure** | Isolated, can use short-lived SSH certs | Risk of credential reuse across network        |
| **Endpoint Trust** | Can validate at jump box                      | Client risk propagates into internal network   |

## ‚úÖ Use Bastion Host When...

- Admins need **controlled, audited access** to specific servers.
- You require **session recording and command control**.
- You're working in a **Zero Trust** or cloud-native environment.

## ‚úÖ Use VPN Access When...

- Users need **broad access to internal apps or systems**.
- You require **site-to-site connectivity**.
- You want a **transparent experience** for end-users.

## üß† Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use **both**:
- VPN for general employee access.
- Bastion for high-privilege administrative access with strict controls.
