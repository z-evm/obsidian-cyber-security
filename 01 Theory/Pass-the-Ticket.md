**Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)** is a post-exploitation technique where an attacker **uses stolen Kerberos tickets** to authenticate to services **without needing the user's password or hash**. It‚Äôs commonly used in **Active Directory (AD)** environments to facilitate **lateral movement** and **privilege escalation**.

> Kerberos tickets = temporary keys. If stolen, they can be reused for unauthorized access.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Reuse **Kerberos TGT or TGS tickets** to impersonate users
- Move **laterally across domain resources**
- Escalate privileges using **high-privilege tickets**
- Maintain **stealthy access** without triggering password-based alerts

---

## üß± How PtT Works

1. Attacker gains initial access to a domain-joined machine
2. Dumps the **Kerberos ticket(s)** from memory (usually LSASS)
3. Injects the ticket into their own session (or a new one)
4. Authenticates as the user whose ticket was stolen
5. Accesses services (e.g., file shares, remote desktop, databases)

‚úÖ No need for NTLM hash or password  
‚úÖ Can impersonate **domain users**, **admins**, or **service accounts**

## üõ† Tools for Pass-the-Ticket

| Tool             | Function                               |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Mimikatz**      | Extract and inject tickets (TGT/TGS)   |
| **Rubeus**        | Ticket manipulation in C#              |
| **Impacket (psexec.py, smbexec.py)** | Uses injected tickets |
| **Kerberos::ptt** | Mimikatz command to perform PtT        |

---

## üìò Mimikatz Example

### üßµ Extract a Ticket:
```powershell
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::tickets
```

### üíâ Inject a Ticket:
```
kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi
```

> After injection, your current session has the same access rights as the ticket‚Äôs original owner.

## üîë Types of Tickets

|Ticket Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**|Used to request service tickets|
|**TGS (Service Ticket)**|Grants access to specific services|

In PtT attacks, **TGTs are ideal**, but **TGS can also be reused** for service-specific access.

## üß† MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

|Technique ID|Name|
|---|---|
|`T1550.003`|Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass-the-Ticket|

---

## üß© Detection Strategies

|Source|What to Monitor|
|---|---|
|**Event ID 4769**|Unusual TGS requests (volume or source)|
|**Sysmon**|Injection into `lsass.exe` or `cmd.exe`|
|**EDR**|Anomalous Kerberos logons or ticket replays|
|**SIEM**|Lateral movement without password use|
|**Logon Events**|Type 3 (network) with high privileges|

---

## üîê Mitigation Strategies

|Defense|Description|
|---|---|
|**LSASS Protection**|Enable Credential Guard or PPL|
|**Limit Ticket Lifetimes**|Reduce TGT lifetime to minimize reuse window|
|**Logon Restrictions**|Restrict admin logons to specific hosts|
|**Detect Ticket Injection**|Use EDR + Sysmon to catch anomalies|
|**Kerberos Armoring**|Use FAST (Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling)|
|**Regularly Rotate KRBTGT**|Prevent long-term ticket reuse|

## ‚úÖ To Do

-  Extract and inject `.kirbi` ticket using Mimikatz in lab
-  Analyze Event ID 4769 behavior in PtT scenario
-  Test detection using Sysmon and EDR telemetry
-  Review KRBTGT rotation policy for your environment
