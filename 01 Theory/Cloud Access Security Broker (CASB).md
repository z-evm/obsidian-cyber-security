A **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)** is a security solution that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications to **monitor activity**, **enforce policies**, and **protect data**. CASBs provide visibility and control over data in cloud services across SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS environments.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Enforce **security policies** on data stored or transmitted in the cloud.
- Enable **visibility**, **compliance**, and **data protection** in cloud usage.
- Detect and respond to **risky behavior**, **shadow IT**, and **insider threats**.
- Support **Zero Trust**, **DLP**, and **identity-based access control** for cloud services.

## üß± CASB Core Functions (The 4 Pillars)

| Pillar                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**          | Discover and inventory all cloud services and usage (including shadow IT). |
| **Compliance**          | Enforce policies to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI). |
| **Data Security**       | Protect sensitive data via encryption, tokenization, and DLP policies.      |
| **Threat Protection**   | Detect malware, account takeovers, and insider threats.                     |

## üîê Deployment Modes

| Mode                  | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API-Based**          | Integrates directly with cloud provider APIs (e.g., Microsoft 365, Salesforce). |
| **Proxy-Based (Forward/Reverse)** | Intercepts traffic to/from cloud apps, enabling inline control.         |
| **Log-Based**          | Uses firewall and proxy logs to detect cloud app usage.                      |
| **Agent-Based**        | Installed on endpoints to monitor and enforce policies locally.              |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Start with **shadow IT discovery** to identify unmanaged cloud usage.
- Integrate CASB with **SIEM** and **identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta)**.
- Use **risk scoring** to prioritize high-risk cloud apps and users.
- Define **granular DLP rules** (e.g., block PII uploads to personal Gmail).
- Regularly **audit CASB policies and alerts** to reduce false positives.
- Enforce **device posture checks** for BYOD or remote access.
