A **Key Management System (KMS)** is a secure solution for generating, storing, distributing, rotating, and revoking cryptographic keys. It plays a central role in ensuring **data confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** across encryption operations.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Securely manage **cryptographic keys** used for data protection.
- Enforce **encryption policies** across systems and services.
- Prevent **unauthorized key access** or misuse.
- Support compliance with standards like **FIPS 140-3**, **HIPAA**, **PCI-DSS**, and **GDPR**.

## üîë Core Functions of a KMS

| Function                  | Description                                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Generation**         | Creation of symmetric/asymmetric encryption keys (e.g., AES, RSA).        |
| **Key Storage**            | Secure storage in software vaults, HSMs, or cloud-managed solutions.       |
| **Key Distribution**       | Secure delivery of keys to authorized endpoints or applications.           |
| **Key Rotation**           | Automatic periodic replacement of keys to reduce exposure.                |
| **Key Revocation**         | Disabling keys after compromise or retirement.                           |
| **Access Control**         | Restrict who can create, view, or use keys (RBAC, IAM policies).           |
| **Audit Logging**          | Record all key usage, access, and administrative actions.                  |
| **Policy Enforcement**     | Enforce lifecycle, strength, and usage rules for key types.               |

## üß± KMS Types

| Type               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Software-Based**  | On-prem KMS deployed in virtual machines or OS-native solutions (e.g., Vault, Windows DPAPI). |
| **Cloud KMS**       | Cloud-native key management offered by providers (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS). |
| **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** | Dedicated physical devices for secure key generation and storage. FIPS 140-3 certified. |
| **Hybrid KMS**      | Combines on-prem HSM with cloud KMS for flexibility and control.            |

## üîê Key Types Managed

| Key Type            | Use Case                                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symmetric Keys**   | Fast encryption (e.g., AES-256 for full disk or backup encryption). |
| **Asymmetric Keys**  | Secure communication and digital signatures (e.g., RSA, ECC).         |
| **Key Encryption Keys (KEK)** | Protect Data Encryption Keys (DEKs).                             |
| **TLS/SSL Certificates** | For HTTPS, email encryption, VPNs.                                |
| **API Keys & Secrets** | Used for service integrations; often vaulted with KMS.               |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Enforce **least privilege access** to keys.
- Use **automated key rotation** (e.g., every 90‚Äì180 days).
- Enable **logging and alerting** for key usage anomalies.
- Use **dedicated KMS/HSM** for highly sensitive or regulated workloads.
- Secure **API access** to the KMS using MFA or signed requests.
- Classify keys based on **risk level and data sensitivity**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Threats and Mitigations

| Threat                        | Mitigation                                                    |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Key leakage via misconfig     | Audit access control policies regularly.                     |
| Stolen credentials            | Enable MFA and session expiration for KMS users.              |
| Unlogged access               | Enable verbose logging and integrate with SIEM tools.         |
| Insecure API usage            | Use TLS and signed requests for all KMS API calls.            |
