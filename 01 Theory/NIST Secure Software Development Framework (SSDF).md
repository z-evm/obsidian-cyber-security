The **NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)**, defined in **NIST SP 800-218**, provides **voluntary, risk-based guidance** on integrating **security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC)**. It helps both producers and consumers of software reduce vulnerabilities and improve software trustworthiness.

## üß± SSDF Core Practices

SSDF consists of **four practice groups**, each containing **tasks and implementation examples**.

### 1. **Prepare the Organization (PO)**

| Code  | Practice                            | Goal                                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| PO.1  | Define security roles & responsibilities | Assign accountability and resources             |
| PO.2  | Implement supporting tools and infrastructure | Support secure development                       |
| PO.3  | Train personnel                      | Security awareness and secure coding knowledge    |

---

### 2. **Protect the Software (PS)**

| Code  | Practice                            | Goal                                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| PS.1  | Secure development environments     | Prevent unauthorized access or changes            |
| PS.2  | Protect code from unauthorized changes | Use source control, code signing, access control |
| PS.3  | Manage sensitive data               | Secure credentials, keys, PII                     |

---

### 3. **Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)**

| Code  | Practice                            | Goal                                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| PW.1  | Define security requirements        | Set baseline standards and controls               |
| PW.2  | Design software to meet requirements| Architect for security (e.g., least privilege)    |
| PW.3  | Implement software securely         | Apply secure coding, input validation, etc.       |
| PW.4  | Review and test code for vulnerabilities | SAST, DAST, SCA, fuzzing                        |
| PW.5  | Reuse secure components             | Prefer proven libraries with known provenance     |

---

### 4. **Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)**

| Code  | Practice                            | Goal                                              |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| RV.1  | Identify and confirm vulnerabilities| Use scanning tools, bug bounty, threat feeds      |
| RV.2  | Assess exploitability and impact    | Prioritize based on risk                          |
| RV.3  | Remediate vulnerabilities           | Apply patches, update SBOMs, track SLA timelines  |
| RV.4  | Communicate with stakeholders       | Notify customers and partners responsibly         |

## üõ°Ô∏è SSDF in Practice

- **Not prescriptive**: Flexible and adaptable to any SDLC (Agile, CI/CD, Waterfall)
- Mapped to **existing standards** like NIST 800-53, ISO 27034, OWASP SAMM
- Encourages use of **SBOMs**, **code signing**, and **secure repositories**
- Aligns with US Executive Order 14028 on **Improving the Nation‚Äôs Cybersecurity**

## üîó Integration with DevSecOps

| DevSecOps Stage  | SSDF Mapping                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Plan**         | PO.1, PW.1, PW.2                                   |
