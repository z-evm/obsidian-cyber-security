# ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Risk Assessment** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks that could negatively affect an organization’s assets, operations, or personnel. It forms the backbone of any effective cybersecurity and risk management strategy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Risk Assessment

- Identify **vulnerabilities** and **threats**
- Evaluate the **likelihood** and **impact** of potential incidents
- Prioritize **risks** for treatment
- Support **decision-making** for risk mitigation, transfer, or acceptance
- Maintain **compliance** with frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS

## 📊 Risk Equation

```text
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
```

**Or more formally in quantitative terms:**
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

## 🧱 Core Components

|Term|Description|
|---|---|
|**Asset**|Something of value (data, system, reputation, physical infrastructure)|
|**Threat**|A potential cause of an unwanted incident (e.g., malware, insider, natural disaster)|
|**Vulnerability**|Weakness that can be exploited by a threat|
|**Impact**|Consequence or harm resulting from a threat exploiting a vulnerability|
|**Likelihood**|Probability of the risk materializing|
|**Risk**|The potential for loss or damage when threats exploit vulnerabilities|

## 🧮 Types of Risk Assessment

### 🔹 Qualitative Risk Assessment

- Uses subjective scales (High/Medium/Low)
- Quick and cost-effective
- Ideal for environments with limited data

> Example:
> 
> - Risk of phishing: High likelihood, Medium impact → High Risk
>     

→ See: [[Qualitative vs Quantitative Risk Assessment]]

---

### 🔹 Quantitative Risk Assessment

- Uses numerical data and financial metrics
- Involves **ALE**, **SLE**, **ARO**
- Ideal for budgeting and ROI calculations

> Example:
> 
> - ALE = $60,000/year → Used to justify $30,000 control
>     

→ See: [[Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)]]
