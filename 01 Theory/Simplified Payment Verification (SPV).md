> Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) allows lightweight Bitcoin clients to verify that a transaction is included in the blockchain **without downloading the full chain**, using Merkle proofs and block headers.

---

## üìå What Is SPV?

- Introduced in **Bitcoin's original whitepaper** (Section 8).
- Enables clients to verify payments using:
  - **Block headers** (not full blocks)
  - **Merkle proofs** for transaction inclusion
- Ideal for **resource-constrained environments** (e.g., mobile wallets).

## üß† Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Light Client**        | Wallet/software that doesn't maintain the full blockchain          |
| **Merkle Proof**        | Compact cryptographic proof that a transaction is in a given block |
| **Block Header**        | 80-byte summary of a block, includes Merkle root and previous hash |
| **SPV Node**            | Client that uses SPV to verify transactions via full nodes         |

> See: [[Merkle Proofs]], [[Bitcoin Architecture]]

## üßæ SPV Process Overview

1. SPV client requests **block headers** from full nodes.
2. When receiving a transaction:
   - The client requests a **Merkle proof** from a full node.
3. It checks:
   - That the transaction‚Äôs hash is part of the **Merkle Root** in a known block.
   - That the block exists in the **longest valid chain**.
4. If valid, the client accepts the transaction as confirmed.

## üì¶ Benefits of SPV

| Benefit                     | Explanation                                                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lightweight**              | Stores only block headers (e.g., ~60MB vs 500+ GB for full nodes) |
| **Fast Sync**                | Quickly usable for most user needs                             |
| **Mobile Friendly**          | Ideal for smartphones, browsers, and embedded devices          |
| **Privacy Preserving**       | Does not reveal full address history like full node wallets    |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of SPV

| Limitation                | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trust Assumptions**      | Relies on full nodes for accurate Merkle proofs             |
| **Vulnerable to Eclipse Attacks** | Malicious peers can isolate and deceive SPV clients     |
| **No Mempool Awareness**   | Cannot see unconfirmed transactions                         |
| **Limited Validation**     | Cannot enforce consensus rules or detect some protocol violations |

---

## üõ° Security Implications

- SPV is secure **if** it connects to **honest full nodes**.
- **Eclipse attacks**, **sybil attacks**, and **false Merkle proofs** are risks without proper peer verification.
- Some clients implement **Bloom filters** or **Neutrino protocols** to enhance privacy and reduce trust requirements.

## üîÑ SPV vs Full Node

| Feature                 | SPV Client                        | Full Node                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Blockchain Copy**     | Headers only                      | Full transaction and block data         |
| **Security Level**      | Medium (depends on peers)         | High (self-validated)                   |
| **Resource Usage**      | Low                               | High (disk, CPU, bandwidth)             |
| **Validation**          | Partial (only Merkle root verified) | Full consensus rule enforcement        |
