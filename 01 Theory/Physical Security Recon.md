**Physical Security Reconnaissance** is the process of collecting information about a facility, personnel, and procedures to plan or simulate unauthorized physical access. It's a critical phase in red team operations and physical penetration testing.

## üéØ Goals of Physical Recon

- Identify **entry points**, **barriers**, and **weak spots**
- Understand **staff behavior**, **shift patterns**, and **badge procedures**
- Gather intelligence on **surveillance**, **alarm systems**, and **response times**
- Support **pretext development** for social engineering

## üß± Physical Recon Techniques

### üëÅÔ∏è Passive Recon

| Method                      | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Google Maps & Street View** | Locate entrances, signage, cameras             |
| **Social media scouting**   | Employees posting photos of badges, interiors   |
| **Public records**          | Building permits, vendor contracts, blueprints  |
| **Dumpster diving**         | Old badges, device packaging, printed schedules |
| **Wi-Fi scanning**          | Identify internal networks or access points     |

### üö∂ Active Recon

| Method                      | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **On-site observation**     | Monitor entrances, exits, guard routines        |
| **Badge tailgating**        | Observe and document tailgate opportunities     |
| **Entry simulation**        | Walk-in attempts (lobby, delivery entrance)      |
| **Physical probing**        | Test unlocked doors, motion sensors, or exits   |
| **Trash inspection**        | Look for passwords, IDs, or diagrams             |

## üì∏ Targets of Interest

| Target Area              | What to Look For                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Perimeter fencing**     | Gaps, jump points, signage                        |
| **Entrances**             | Locked/unlocked, mantraps, turnstiles, card readers |
| **Badge system**          | Format, color, photo, RFID/NFC use                |
| **Surveillance cameras**  | Angle, range, blind spots                         |
| **Visitor procedures**    | Sign-in, escort requirements, badge policy        |
| **Employee behavior**     | Door-holding, badge display, workstation access   |

## üõ† Recon Tools

| Tool / Method            | Use Case                                       |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Camera with zoom lens** | Document badge design, surveillance layout     |
| **RFID scanner (e.g., Proxmark3)** | Identify and clone low-frequency badges |
| **Flipper Zero**         | NFC, RFID, IR testing                          |
| **Wi-Fi analyzer**       | Identify access points and rogue devices       |
| **Binoculars / monoculars** | Long-range facility observation             |
| **Lock impressioning kit** | (Authorized engagements only)                |

## üß† Pretext Planning from Recon

- **Delivery personnel**
- **Vendor/contractor (IT, copier repair, pest control)**
- **Prospective employee/interviewee**
- **Health/safety inspector**
- **Conference or meeting attendee**

Use badge design, dress code, or lingo collected during recon to improve authenticity.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

- Always operate under a signed **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
- Follow **local laws** on observation, photography, and device usage
- Avoid endangering real operations (e.g., triggering fire alarms)
