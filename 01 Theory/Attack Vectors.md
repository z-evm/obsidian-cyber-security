> An attack vector is the **path or method** used by threat actors to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data. Understanding these vectors is essential to identifying vulnerabilities and implementing defensive controls.

## üìå What Is an Attack Vector?

- A specific **route, toolset, or technique** an attacker uses to exploit a vulnerability.
- Can be **technical**, **physical**, or **social** in nature.
- Often used in combination to increase effectiveness (e.g., phishing + malware).
