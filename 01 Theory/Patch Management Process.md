**Patch Management** is the systematic process of identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying updates to software and systems to fix vulnerabilities, bugs, and improve performance.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 🛡️ **Mitigate security vulnerabilities**
- 🔁 **Maintain system stability and performance**
- 📋 **Ensure regulatory compliance**
- ⏱️ **Respond promptly to emerging threats**

---

## 🔄 Patch Management Lifecycle

### 1. 🔍 **Inventory & Asset Identification**
- Maintain an up-to-date list of hardware/software assets.
- Categorize systems by criticality and exposure.

### 2. 📢 **Vulnerability & Patch Notification**
- Subscribe to vendor alerts (e.g., Microsoft, Cisco).
- Monitor CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
- Use vulnerability scanning tools.

### 3. 🧪 **Patch Testing**
- Test patches in a **staging environment**.
- Ensure patches do not break existing functionality.
- Simulate real-world configurations.

### 4. ✅ **Approval and Change Management**
- Follow change management processes (CAB review, rollback plan).
- Coordinate deployment windows with stakeholders.

### 5. 🚀 **Patch Deployment**
- Use centralized tools (e.g., WSUS, SCCM, Ansible, PDQ Deploy).
- Automate where possible for consistency.
- Prioritize **critical security patches**.

### 6. 🔎 **Verification & Auditing**
- Validate successful patch deployment.
- Re-run vulnerability scans.
- Check system and application logs.

### 7. 📁 **Documentation & Reporting**
- Record patch versions, system impact, and any incidents.
- Create audit trails for compliance (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.).

## 🚨 Challenges & Risks

- Patch failures or system crashes
- Compatibility issues
- User downtime or operational disruption
- Patch delays leading to exploitation (e.g., zero-days)

---

## 🧾 Best Practices

- 🧪 Test patches before deployment
- ⏱ Patch critical vulnerabilities within 24–72 hours
- 🔐 Backup systems before patching
- 📊 Track patch status with dashboards
- 🔁 Schedule regular patch cycles (e.g., monthly)
- 🔒 Prioritize security patches for internet-facing systems
