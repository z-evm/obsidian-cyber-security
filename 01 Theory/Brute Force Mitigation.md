**Brute force attacks** involve systematically guessing passwords, encryption keys, or authentication tokens to gain unauthorized access. **Mitigation strategies** aim to slow down, detect, or completely block these attempts.

---

## üéØ Goal of Brute Force Mitigation

- Prevent unauthorized access via credential guessing
- Protect authentication systems and user accounts
- Minimize risk of **credential stuffing** and **password spraying**
- Ensure secure **availability** and **authentication integrity**

## üîì Types of Brute Force Attacks

| Type                    | Description                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classic Brute Force**  | Tries every combination of characters (e.g., `aaaa`, `aaab`, etc.) |
| **Dictionary Attack**    | Uses wordlists of common passwords                                |
| **Credential Stuffing**  | Uses breached credentials on multiple services                    |
| **Password Spraying**    | Tries a few common passwords across many users                    |
| **Offline Brute Force**  | Cracks hashes captured from a database or file                    |

## üõ°Ô∏è Brute Force Mitigation Techniques

| Control Type     | Strategy                                                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preventive**   | Password complexity, MFA, lockout policies                       |
| **Detective**    | SIEM alerts, IDS/IPS, login anomaly detection                    |
| **Corrective**   | Reset accounts, revoke sessions, isolate suspicious systems      |
| **Technical**    | Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, account throttling, password hashing     |
| **Managerial**   | User training, policy enforcement, regular credential audits     |

## üß∞ Mitigation Methods

### 1. **Account Lockout Policy**
- Lock accounts temporarily after a threshold of failed attempts
- Prevents automated scripts from unlimited guesses

### 2. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
- Slow down login requests after X attempts
- Introduce delay (e.g., exponential backoff) between retries

### 3. **CAPTCHA / ReCAPTCHA**
- Blocks automated bots from guessing passwords
- Effective at stopping web-based brute force tools

### 4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Adds a layer beyond the password
- Even if a password is guessed, attacker lacks second factor

### 5. **Strong Password Policies**
- Encourage long, unique passphrases over forced complexity
- Enforce minimum length and block common passwords

### 6. **IP Reputation Blocking / Geo-fencing**
- Block known malicious IPs or countries not relevant to business

## üß™ Example Policy Setup

| Policy Element             | Recommended Setting         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Lockout threshold          | 5 failed attempts           |
| Lockout duration           | 15 minutes                  |
| Password minimum length    | 12 characters               |
| Password expiration        | Only on compromise          |
| MFA                        | Enabled for all logins      |
| CAPTCHA                    | After 3 failed attempts     |

## üõë Common Mistakes

| Mistake                     | Risk                                                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| No account lockout          | Vulnerable to high-speed brute force                          |
| Weak password requirements  | Easier for attackers to guess or crack                        |
| Allowing unlimited login attempts | Open invitation for automated attacks                    |
| Lack of user alerts         | Users unaware of compromise or attack attempts                |
