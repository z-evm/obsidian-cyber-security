**Audit logging and monitoring** are essential components of cybersecurity, enabling organizations to detect, respond to, and investigate security incidents through recorded system activity.

## 🧠 What Is Audit Logging?

An **audit log** is a chronological record of system events, user actions, and security-related activities. Logs provide visibility into **who did what, when, and where**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🕵️ Detect unauthorized access or anomalies
- 📈 Monitor critical systems and data
- 🧾 Provide evidence for forensic investigations
- ✅ Ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX)
- 📢 Enable real-time alerting of threats

## 🧱 Key Log Types

| Log Type             | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Logs**      | OS-level events, startups, shutdowns, services        |
| **Application Logs** | Software-specific events and errors                   |
| **Authentication Logs** | Logon attempts, failures, lockouts                  |
| **Access Logs**      | Resource access events (files, folders, databases)    |
| **Firewall Logs**    | Allowed/denied traffic, connection attempts           |
| **IDS/IPS Logs**     | Intrusion detection/prevention alerts                 |
| **SIEM Logs**        | Aggregated events from multiple sources               |
| **Audit Trails**     | Sequenced records for accountability                  |

## 🛠 Logging Tools and Technologies

| Tool/Tech       | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Syslog**       | Standard protocol for system logging         |
| **SIEM**         | Centralizes logs and provides correlation    |
| **Windows Event Viewer** | View system/application/security logs |
| **Linux Journalctl** | Manage logs on systemd-based distros      |
| **CloudWatch / Azure Monitor** | Cloud-native logging and alerting |

## 🧾 Monitoring Activities

- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detect suspicious behavior (e.g., brute force attacks, lateral movement)
- 🔔 **Alerts and Notifications**: Threshold-based or anomaly-based triggers
- 🔍 **Log Review and Analysis**: Manual or automated review of log patterns
- 🔁 **Log Retention**: Keep logs per compliance and policy (e.g., 90 days to 7+ years)
- 🧮 **Log Normalization**: Convert logs into a standard format for analysis

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 📌 **Enable auditing on all critical systems**
- 🔐 **Secure log storage**: Prevent tampering and unauthorized access
- 🧪 **Test logging configurations** regularly
- ⏳ **Use timestamps and time sync (e.g., NTP)**
- 📁 **Separate logs by source and sensitivity**
- 🔄 **Review logs regularly** as part of security operations
- 🧾 **Retain logs per regulatory and business needs**

---

## ⚠️ Logging Challenges

- 🔍 Volume and noise in high-traffic systems
- ⛔ Log tampering or deletion by insiders or malware
- 🧩 Incomplete logging coverage
- 🧱 Lack of correlation across platforms
