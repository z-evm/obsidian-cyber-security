A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit that monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cybersecurity threats in real time. It acts as the **nerve center** for an organization’s security operations.

## 🎯 Objectives of a SOC

- 🕵️ Continuous monitoring of systems and networks
- 🚨 Detect and respond to security incidents
- 📊 Analyze threats and security trends
- 🛡️ Minimize attack impact and response time
- ✅ Ensure compliance and audit readiness

## 🧱 SOC Core Functions

| Function                | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Monitoring**           | Use SIEMs, IDS/IPS, EDR tools to monitor logs and alerts     |
| **Detection**            | Identify anomalous or malicious activity                     |
| **Investigation**        | Analyze alerts and events to determine root cause            |
| **Incident Response**    | Contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents      |
| **Threat Hunting**       | Proactively search for hidden threats and IOCs               |
| **Reporting & Compliance** | Document incidents, generate reports, maintain audit trails |

## 🧠 SOC Team Roles

| Role                     | Responsibilities                                              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1 Analyst (Alert Analyst)** | Monitor dashboards, triage alerts, escalate incidents      |
| **Tier 2 Analyst (Incident Responder)** | Investigate incidents, run playbooks, escalate threats   |
| **Tier 3 Analyst (Threat Hunter)** | Proactively search for advanced persistent threats (APT)   |
| **SOC Manager**          | Oversee operations, manage teams, report to stakeholders      |
| **Forensic Analyst**     | Conduct deep dives and post-incident investigations           |
| **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Analyze external threat intel and enrich alerts             |

## ✅ Best Practices

- 📜 Use defined **incident response playbooks**
- 🔁 Perform **24/7 monitoring and alerting**
- 🧪 Regularly test detection rules and escalation paths
- 📊 Maintain dashboards for KPIs and metrics (MTTD, MTTR)
- 🧾 Keep up-to-date documentation and compliance records

## 📈 SOC Metrics and KPIs

| Metric             | Meaning                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **MTTD**           | Mean Time to Detect                        |
| **MTTR**           | Mean Time to Respond/Remediate             |
| **False Positive Rate** | Noise level in alerting system           |
| **Incident Volume**| Total number of incidents handled          |
| **Detection Coverage** | % of attack surfaces monitored           |
