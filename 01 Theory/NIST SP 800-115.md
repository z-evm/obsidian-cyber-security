**NIST Special Publication 800-115** provides a standardized framework and methodology for planning and executing **technical information security assessments** including **vulnerability scanning**, **penetration testing**, and **security testing**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of NIST SP 800-115

- 🛠 Guide organizations in evaluating the security posture of systems
- 📋 Standardize testing approaches for consistency and rigor
- 🧠 Provide actionable results for improving defenses
- ⚖️ Support compliance and risk management efforts

## 🧱 Assessment Types Defined

| Assessment Type       | Description                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Testing**             | Hands-on validation using tools and scripts                     |
| **Examination**         | Manual inspection of documents, configurations, or code         |
| **Interview**           | Verbal verification of security procedures with personnel       |

## 🔄 NIST Assessment Lifecycle

### 1. 🧾 **Planning**
- Define objectives, scope, rules of engagement
- Identify systems, personnel, and data involved
- Set timelines and communication protocols
- Evaluate risks and obtain **authorization**

### 2. 🔍 **Discovery**
- Information gathering (active and passive)
- Identify target systems, network ranges, technologies
- Perform vulnerability scans and reconnaissance

### 3. 🎯 **Attack (Exploit)**
- Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
- Confirm presence and impact of security weaknesses
- Simulate attacker behavior (while minimizing risk)

### 4. 🧾 **Reporting**
- Summarize findings and their severity
- Map findings to organizational assets and impact
- Provide **remediation recommendations**
- Document **methodology** and **tools used**

## 🛠 Assessment Techniques (as per NIST)

| Category               | Techniques Included                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Discovery**   | Ping sweeps, port scans, service fingerprinting  |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys                       |
| **Password Cracking**  | Dictionary attacks, brute force, hash cracking  |
| **Penetration Testing**| Exploitation of weaknesses                      |
| **Social Engineering** | Phishing, pretexting (if authorized)            |
| **Wireless Testing**   | Wardriving, rogue AP detection                   |

## ⚖️ Rules of Engagement (ROE)

- 📜 Written agreement required before testing begins
- 🎯 Clearly define in-scope vs out-of-scope systems
- 📅 Set testing windows and escalation paths
- ❌ Establish limitations (e.g., no denial of service attacks)
- 🔐 Maintain confidentiality and data protection

---

## ✅ Best Practices According to NIST 800-115

- Include **internal stakeholders** during planning
- Test during **realistic business operations**
- Avoid **unintentional damage** by simulating, not fully exploiting
- Map findings to **risk impact**
- Prioritize **repeatability** and **documentation**
