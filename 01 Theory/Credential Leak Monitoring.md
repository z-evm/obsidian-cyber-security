**Credential Leak Monitoring** is the practice of detecting when usernames, email addresses, or passwords have been exposed in public or dark web breaches. These leaks can lead to credential stuffing, phishing, and account takeovers (ATO) if not identified and mitigated swiftly.

> üß† *Credentials are the new perimeter‚Äîmonitoring them is essential for modern security.*

## üéØ Goals of Credential Leak Monitoring

- Detect **exposed credentials** related to users, domains, or execs
- Prevent **account takeover (ATO)** and **lateral movement**
- Reduce risk from **password reuse** across platforms
- Provide early warnings for **phishing campaigns** or **insider threats**

## üîç Common Sources of Leaked Credentials

| Source               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Data breach dumps** | Released on forums, Telegram, paste sites       |
| **Pastebin / Ghostbin** | Common drop site for credentials              |
| **Dark web marketplaces** | Sell breach data or provide search engines |
| **Public GitHub repos** | Hardcoded credentials or API tokens           |
| **Info-stealer logs**  | Logs from malware like RedLine, Raccoon, etc.  |

## üö® Monitoring Tactics

- Monitor company domains and executive emails
- Set up **alerting for known breach keywords**
- Use **SIEM correlation** (e.g., login after breach alert)
- Search breach dumps for **password reuse** across services
- Track leaked **OAuth tokens and API keys**

| **Force password reset**      | Immediately reset exposed credentials       |
| **Enable MFA**                | Prevents use even if credentials are leaked |
| **Monitor logins**            | Geo-aware and behavior-aware login alerts   |
| **Educate users**             | Training on phishing, password managers     |
| **Block credentials reuse**   | Enforce unique passwords per system         |
| **Rotate API tokens/keys**    | If discovered in leaks or GitHub            |
