## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Detect and analyze malware infections
- 🧬 Identify malware types and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- 🧠 Understand infection vectors and behavior
- 🧾 Support evidence collection and attribution

## 🧱 Types of Malware

| Type            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Virus**         | Self-replicating program that infects files |
| **Worm**          | Spreads autonomously over networks |
| **Trojan Horse**  | Disguised as legitimate software |
| **Rootkit**       | Hides malware presence by altering system processes |
| **Ransomware**    | Encrypts files and demands payment |
| **Spyware**       | Covertly gathers user or system data |
| **Keylogger**     | Captures keystrokes to steal credentials |
| **Logic Bomb**    | Executes malicious code when triggered |

## 🔍 Malware Detection Methods

### ✅ Signature-Based Detection
- Matches code patterns to known malware
- Fast but ineffective against zero-days

### 🧠 Heuristic & Behavioral Detection
- Analyzes code behavior and anomalies
- Detects polymorphic/mutating malware

### 🔬 Sandboxing
- Executes suspicious code in isolated environments
- Observes runtime behavior and system interaction

### 📊 Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
- Monitors real-time endpoint activity
- Detects lateral movement, privilege escalation

## 🛠 Tools for Detection

| Tool              | Use Case |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Windows Defender / AV Tools** | Signature and heuristic scanning |
| **YARA**           | Pattern-matching malware rules |
| **Sysinternals Suite** | Live system investigation |
| **Procmon / Process Explorer** | Process, registry, and file activity |
| **Wireshark**      | Packet capture and analysis |
| **Volatility Framework** | Memory forensics |
| **Cuckoo Sandbox** | Behavioral analysis in isolated VM |

## 🧬 Malware Forensics Workflow

1. **Identification**
   - Alert triggered via AV, EDR, or user report
   - Collect IOCs (hashes, filenames, IPs, mutexes)

2. **Isolation**
   - Quarantine infected system
   - Block network communications

3. **Acquisition**
   - Create bit-for-bit image (e.g., `.dd`, `.img`)
   - Dump memory for analysis

4. **Analysis**
   - Static: Inspect binaries, strings, file headers
   - Dynamic: Execute in sandbox, observe behavior
   - Correlate with logs, network traffic, file changes

5. **Documentation & Reporting**
   - Create incident timeline
   - Preserve chain of custody
   - Share IOCs with threat intel feeds

6. **Remediation**
   - Remove malware
   - Patch exploited vulnerabilities
   - Restore from backups
   - Strengthen defenses

## 📦 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- 🔑 Hashes (MD5, SHA-256)
- 🧪 Malicious file names or paths
- 🌐 IP addresses and domains
- 🧬 Registry modifications
- 🕵️ Suspicious processes or services
- 📄 Log entries showing privilege abuse or access anomalies

---

## 📋 Best Practices

- 🛡 Enable antivirus and EDR across all endpoints
- 🔄 Keep signatures and definitions up to date
- 📚 Maintain an updated incident response playbook
- 🧪 Perform regular malware simulation and threat hunts
- 🔐 Limit admin rights and enforce application allow-listing
