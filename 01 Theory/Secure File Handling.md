## üéØ Purpose

To define the secure handling, transfer, storage, and disposal of files to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, or regulatory non-compliance. This policy supports the protection of sensitive and classified information in accordance with the organization‚Äôs data classification standards.

---

## üß± Scope

This policy applies to:
- All personnel (employees, contractors, vendors)
- All systems, devices, and platforms used to handle files
- All types of files, especially those classified as **Confidential** or **Restricted**

## üóÇ Classification-Based Handling

| Classification Level | Encryption at Rest | Encryption in Transit | Access Restrictions         | Transfer Method                          |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Public**           | Optional           | Optional               | None                        | Any                                        |
| **Internal**         | Recommended        | Yes                    | Authenticated internal users| Corporate email, intranet, SFTP           |
| **Confidential**     | Mandatory (AES-256)| Mandatory (TLS 1.2+)   | RBAC, MFA, audit logging    | SFTP, encrypted email, secure portals     |
| **Restricted**       | Mandatory (AES-256)| Mandatory (TLS 1.3+)   | Least privilege + encryption| DLP + secure vaults + tamper-evident logs |

---

## üì¶ Storage Requirements

- Files must be stored in secured file systems or repositories (e.g., SharePoint, S3, ShareDrive) with proper ACLs.
- Avoid storing sensitive files on local machines unless encrypted and temporary.
- Use [[Encryption Standards]] for file storage and full disk encryption.

## üöö File Transfer Guidelines

| Method       | Security Requirements                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Email        | Encrypt attachments with S/MIME, PGP, or ZIP AES  |
| Cloud Drives | Enforce access control, sharing restrictions       |
| FTP/SFTP     | Use SFTP only (no plain FTP), with key-based auth  |
| File Sharing | Use secure web portals with expiration + download limits |

---

## üß® File Upload & Download

- Antivirus and sandbox scanning required for all incoming files
- Restrict file types (e.g., block `.exe`, `.bat`, `.js`, etc.)
- Validate MIME types and use file integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256)
- Implement file upload size limits and throttling

---

## üóë Secure File Disposal

| File Type        | Disposal Method                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Digital files    | Cryptographic wipe or shred tools (e.g., `sdelete`, `shred`) |
| Physical media   | Degaussing or incineration       |
| Paper documents  | Cross-cut shredding              |

> **Retention compliance** must be verified prior to deletion. See [[Data Retention Policy]].

## üß∞ Related Tools

- **Encryption**: VeraCrypt, BitLocker, GPG
- **Transfer**: FileZilla (SFTP), MFT tools, Encrypted ZIPs
- **DLP**: Microsoft Purview, Symantec DLP, CrowdStrike
- **Secure Storage**: AWS S3 with KMS, OneDrive with Sensitivity Labels
