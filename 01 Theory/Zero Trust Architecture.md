**Zero Trust** is a cybersecurity model that assumes **no implicit trust**, regardless of network location or user role. Instead, every access request must be **explicitly verified, authorized, and continuously validated** ‚Äî even for internal users or systems.

> Trust nothing. Verify everything.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Zero Trust answers the question:**  
> _"How can we enforce secure access when the perimeter no longer exists?"_

Goals:
- Eliminate **implicit trust**
- Enforce **least privilege** access
- Minimize lateral movement by attackers
- Strengthen **identity, device, and data security**

## üß± Core Principles

| Principle                     | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verify Explicitly**         | Always authenticate and authorize access                     |
| **Least Privilege Access**    | Limit user/system permissions to the minimum necessary        |
| **Assume Breach**             | Operate as if an attacker is already inside the network       |
| **Microsegmentation**         | Divide networks into isolated zones to limit attack surface   |
| **Continuous Monitoring**     | Monitor user and system behavior in real-time                 |

## üîê Zero Trust Pillars

| Pillar             | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity**         | Authenticate every user and device using MFA       |
| **Device**           | Assess device posture, OS patch level, compliance  |
| **Network**          | Enforce segmentation, encryption, and access policies |
| **Application**      | Restrict access to applications based on roles     |
| **Data**             | Classify and protect sensitive data                |
| **Analytics**        | Monitor events, detect anomalies, and respond      |

## üìã Implementation Steps

1. **Define Protect Surface** ‚Äì Focus on key assets (data, apps, users)
2. **Map Data Flows** ‚Äì Understand how traffic moves between assets
3. **Create Microperimeters** ‚Äì Limit access around critical resources
4. **Implement Strong Identity Controls** ‚Äì MFA, SSO, role-based access
5. **Continuously Monitor and Improve** ‚Äì Validate behavior, update policies
