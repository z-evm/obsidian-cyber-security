## üéØ Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature                 | Antivirus (AV)                           | Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat Detection**     | Signature and heuristic-based            | Behavioral analysis, heuristics, threat intel    |
| **Response Capabilities**| Limited (quarantine/delete)             | Real-time isolation, kill process, rollback      |
| **Visibility**           | Minimal logs                            | Full endpoint activity tracking & forensics      |
| **Threat Coverage**      | Known malware, viruses                  | Malware, fileless attacks, APTs, insider threats |
| **Investigation Tools**  | None or limited                         | Built-in tools for root cause & timeline         |
| **Integration**          | Standalone                              | SIEM, SOAR, XDR integration                      |

## üß™ What is Antivirus (AV)?

A traditional **endpoint security tool** designed to detect, block, and remove **known malware** using:

- üß¨ **Signature matching**
- üß† **Heuristics**
- üóÉÔ∏è Predefined malware databases

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- Lightweight and easy to manage
- Effective against common threats
- Often preinstalled or bundled

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
- Can‚Äôt detect **zero-day** or **fileless attacks**
- Limited visibility or response capability
- High false-negative rate for advanced threats

---

## üß† What is EDR?

**EDR** is a modern solution that provides continuous monitoring and analysis of endpoint behavior to:

- Detect advanced or unknown threats
- Enable **real-time response** and investigation
- Support **incident response** and **forensics**

### üß∞ Key Features:
- Behavioral threat detection
- Full attack timeline and root cause analysis
- Process, registry, memory, and network monitoring
- Automated and manual containment
- Threat intelligence integration

## üîÅ AV vs EDR Use Case Scenarios

| Scenario                       | AV              | EDR                        |
|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Detect known virus            | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Investigate lateral movement  | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Kill malicious script process | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Roll back ransomware impact   | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Yes (some EDRs)           |
| Block USB-based attack        | ‚ùå Limited       | ‚úÖ With policy enforcement   |

## üõ°Ô∏è Ideal Deployment Strategy

- üß± Use **EDR for proactive protection** and deep visibility
- üîÑ Combine with **Antivirus for baseline detection**
- üí° Choose EDR solutions with **integrated AV engines**

> Many modern EDR platforms **replace or integrate AV** to provide layered protection from a single agent.
