**Security assessments** and **audits** are essential practices used to evaluate an organization’s security posture. While both involve evaluation, they differ in **scope, intent, and depth**.

## 🧱 Key Differences

| Term               | Security Assessment                             | Security Audit                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations     | Verify compliance with policies/regulations |
| **Focus**           | Improvement and risk mitigation                 | Verification and accountability             |
| **Approach**        | Informal or formal, technical testing            | Formal, checklist-driven, documentation-based |
| **Conducted By**    | Internal teams, security consultants            | Internal audit teams or third parties       |
| **Output**          | Recommendations, risk findings                  | Pass/fail status, compliance report         |

## 🧠 Security Assessment Types

### 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities (e.g., missing patches, weak configs)
- Tools: Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS

### 💥 Penetration Testing
- Simulated attack to exploit vulnerabilities and measure real-world risk
- Tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite, Kali Linux

### 🛡 Configuration Review
- Manual inspection of system and application configurations
- Goal: Harden systems per secure baselines (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)

### 📜 Policy Review
- Ensure written policies align with actual practices
- Assess gaps in acceptable use, password, backup, and incident response policies

## ✅ Security Audit Components

| Component           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Scope Definition** | Define systems, departments, or processes to review |
| **Policy Alignment** | Map practices against internal and external standards (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001) |
| **Control Testing**  | Verify technical, administrative, and physical controls |
| **Evidence Collection** | Review logs, tickets, configurations, and user access records |
| **Report Findings**  | Identify non-compliance, provide audit trail, suggest corrective actions |

## 🔧 Common Audit Frameworks & Standards

- **NIST SP 800-53** – Security control baseline for federal systems
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- **CIS Controls** – Best-practice controls for cybersecurity hygiene
- **SOC 2** – Trust service principles for service providers
- **PCI DSS** – Payment card industry data security standard

---

## 🛠 Tools for Assessment & Audit

- **Nessus / OpenVAS** – Vulnerability scanning
- **Metasploit / Nmap** – Pentesting and reconnaissance
- **SIEM (Splunk, QRadar)** – Audit trail and log review
- **GRC Platforms** – Risk and compliance management
- **CIS-CAT Pro** – Benchmarks and system configuration checks

---

## 📋 Best Practices

- 📅 Schedule assessments regularly (e.g., quarterly scans, annual audits)
- 🧩 Combine manual review with automated tools
- 📊 Report risk levels and prioritize remediation
- 📁 Maintain documentation and audit trails
- 🔁 Use findings to improve security controls and training
