**Adversary Emulation** is the practice of simulating real-world adversary behavior ‚Äî including **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** ‚Äî in a controlled environment to test the effectiveness of security controls, detection logic, and incident response processes.

---

## üéØ Objectives of Adversary Emulation

- **Validate detections** against known threat actors
- Improve **threat visibility** and SOC response
- Identify **gaps** in logging, alerting, or control coverage
- Test blue team readiness and playbooks
- Map security effectiveness to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework

> "Don't just test if a door is locked ‚Äî emulate the burglar."

## üß± Emulation vs. Simulation vs. Red Team

| Term                  | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary Emulation** | Models specific threat actor behavior (TTPs)     |
| **Attack Simulation**   | Broader, often automated testing (e.g., BAS tools)|
| **Red Teaming**         | Full-scope, stealthy adversary campaign          |

---

## üß† Key Frameworks & Models

### MITRE ATT&CK
- Maps known techniques used by real threat groups
- Used to **design emulation plans** and **track coverage**

### MITRE CALDERA
- Automated adversary emulation platform
- Uses plugins (agents, abilities, adversaries)

### Atomic Red Team
- Library of **small, testable emulation scripts** (TTP-level)
- YAML-based + cross-platform

## üõ† Tools for Adversary Emulation

| Tool / Project         | Description                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **CALDERA**            | MITRE‚Äôs modular emulation framework           |
| **Atomic Red Team**    | Easy-to-run emulation tests (TTPs)            |
| **Red Canary Simulator**| Lightweight behavioral test suite           |
| **Metasploit / Cobalt Strike** | Manual control for advanced emulation |
| **Infection Monkey**   | Self-propagating adversary simulator          |
| **Invoke-AtomicRedTeam**| PowerShell automation for Atomic tests       |

## üìò Example: Emulating APT29 (Cozy Bear)

**Objective:** Test detection of credential dumping and PowerShell-based lateral movement

1. **Initial Access:** Drop a payload using macro-enabled document
2. **Execution:** Spawn PowerShell with encoded command
3. **Persistence:** Create scheduled task or registry autorun
4. **Credential Access:** Dump LSASS using `procdump` or Mimikatz
5. **Lateral Movement:** Use `PsExec` or `WMI` to move laterally
6. **Exfiltration:** Archive files and simulate outbound traffic

Mapped to MITRE:
- T1059 (PowerShell)
- T1003 (Credential Dumping)
- T1053 (Scheduled Task)
- T1021 (Remote Services)

## üî¨ Emulation Process

1. **Select Threat Actor or Campaign**
   - Based on threat intel or MITRE ATT&CK group profiles

2. **Break into TTPs**
   - Extract atomic behaviors from incident reports or ATT&CK

3. **Build Playbook / Emulation Plan**
   - Use tools like Atomic Red Team or manual scripting

4. **Execute in Controlled Environment**
   - Use test systems, purple team ranges, or detection sandboxes

5. **Observe and Validate**
   - Confirm alerting, logging, and analyst response

6. **Document Gaps & Improve**
   - Refine rules, tune logs, update response procedures

## üîê Best Practices

- **Use realistic environments**: mimic production configs
- **Coordinate with blue team** (if not red team exercise)
- **Log all activity** for transparency and repeatability
- **Chain techniques** into realistic kill chains
- **Test coverage regularly**, not just one-off

---

## üß† Use Cases

- SOC alert testing and validation
- Purple team exercises
- Pre-deployment control validation
- Detection-as-Code pipelines (CI/CD for security rules)
- ATT&CK coverage heatmapping

## ‚úÖ To Do

- [ ] Set up CALDERA or Atomic Red Team in test lab
- [ ] Map top 5 threats to MITRE TTPs and test coverage
- [ ] Create emulation runbooks per ATT&CK tactic
- [ ] Build dashboard to track detection coverage over time
