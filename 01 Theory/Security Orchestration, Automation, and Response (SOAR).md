**SOAR** is a class of tools and processes that allow Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to **orchestrate workflows**, **automate repetitive tasks**, and **respond to incidents more efficiently**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of SOAR

- ⚡ Speed up incident response
- 📉 Reduce analyst fatigue and manual workload
- 🧠 Ensure consistent execution of playbooks
- 🧾 Improve documentation and audit trails
- 🤝 Integrate multiple security tools into a unified workflow

## 🧱 SOAR Components

| Component        | Description                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestration** | Connects disparate security tools (SIEM, EDR, ticketing, etc.) |
| **Automation**    | Executes tasks without human input (e.g., IP blocking)         |
| **Response**      | Facilitates investigation and remediation actions              |
| **Case Management** | Tracks incidents, playbook runs, analyst notes                |

---

## ⚙️ Common Use Cases

- Auto-block IPs/domains from threat intel feeds
- Auto-quarantine infected endpoints via EDR
- Enrich alerts with context (WHOIS, VirusTotal, geolocation)
- Open and update tickets in ITSM platforms
- Run malware sandboxing automatically

---

## 🔄 SOAR Workflow Example

```plaintext
SIEM Alert: Suspicious login
   ↓
SOAR triggers playbook
   ↓
1. Gather user context from AD
2. Check geolocation & device fingerprint
3. If abnormal:
   - Disable user in AD
   - Send Slack alert
   - Open ServiceNow ticket
```

## ✅ Benefits

- ⚡ Faster incident resolution (reduced **MTTR**)
- 📋 Consistent and repeatable responses
- 🧠 Empower Tier 1 analysts with guided actions
- 🔍 Improved visibility into incident timelines
