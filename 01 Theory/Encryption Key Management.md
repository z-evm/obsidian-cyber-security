**Encryption Key Management** refers to the secure handling of cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle ‚Äî from generation and distribution to storage, usage, rotation, and eventual destruction.

Proper key management is essential to maintaining the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of encrypted data.

## üéØ Purpose

> **Key Management answers the question:**  
> _"Are encryption keys secure and controlled?"_

Without secure key management, even strong encryption becomes ineffective.

## üîÅ Key Lifecycle Phases

| Phase           | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generation**   | Create keys using secure, random, cryptographic methods |
| **Distribution** | Securely deliver keys to authorized users/devices       |
| **Storage**      | Safeguard keys in encrypted and tamper-resistant formats|
| **Rotation**     | Regularly replace keys to limit exposure                |
| **Revocation**   | Invalidate compromised or unused keys                   |
| **Destruction**  | Securely delete keys when no longer needed              |

## üõ° Best Practices

| Practice                        | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use a Key Management System (KMS)** | Automate and secure key handling (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) |
| **Enforce Key Usage Limits**   | Restrict key use by time, location, or app                   |
| **Encrypt Keys at Rest**       | Always store keys in encrypted form                         |
| **Isolate Keys from Data**     | Never store keys and encrypted data together                |
| **Audit Key Access**           | Monitor usage with SIEM or logging tools                    |
| **Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** | Physically secure key storage                              |

## üîê Key Types and Contexts

| Key Type            | Used In                          | Notes                                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Symmetric Key**    | AES, VPNs, File Encryption        | Same key for encrypt/decrypt             |
| **Private Key**      | Digital Signatures, TLS          | Must be kept secret                      |
| **Public Key**       | Certificate Exchange, Email      | Distributed openly                       |
| **Session Key**      | TLS, IPsec                       | Temporary symmetric key per session      |
| **Master Key**       | KMS or HSM Systems               | Derives or protects other keys           |

| Tool/Technology        | Function                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **HSM (Hardware Security Module)** | Physical device for secure key storage     |
| **KMS (Key Management Service)**   | Centralized key lifecycle management       |
| **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**| Handles certificate-based key exchange     |
| **Secrets Management Tools**      | Tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Key Management Risks

- Storing keys with encrypted data
- Using weak or reused keys
- Improper disposal of old keys
- Lack of access controls or audit trails
- Failing to rotate or expire keys regularly

---

## üîÑ Key Rotation Policies

- Regularly rotate long-term keys (e.g., every 12 months)
- Immediately rotate keys if:
  - They‚Äôre suspected of being compromised
  - A user leaves the organization
  - A certificate expires or is revoked

## üß¨ Real-World Applications

| Scenario                           | Key Management Role                                |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Securing cloud storage (S3, Blob) | Encrypt files with KMS-managed keys                |
| TLS handshake                     | Exchange and verify session keys securely          |
| Encrypted backup systems           | Keys rotated and stored in HSMs                    |
| Email encryption (PGP/S/MIME)      | Key pairs managed and exchanged securely           |
