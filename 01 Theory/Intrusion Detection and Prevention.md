## üß† Detection Techniques

| Technique           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Signature-Based**  | Matches known patterns (like antivirus) ‚Üí fast but blind to unknown threats |
| **Anomaly-Based**    | Flags behavior that deviates from established baselines                    |
| **Heuristic/Behavioral** | Uses rule sets or logic to infer malicious behavior                   |
| **Hybrid**           | Combines multiple methods for broader coverage                             |

## üß∞ IDS/IPS Deployment Types

| Type          | Description                                   | Placement Example               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Network-based (NIDS/NIPS)** | Monitors entire network traffic      | SPAN port, inline firewall       |
| **Host-based (HIDS/HIPS)**   | Monitors activity on individual systems | Endpoint agents                 |
| **Cloud-based**              | Integrated into cloud workload environments | CSP-native tools               |
| **Wireless IDS**             | Detects rogue APs, wireless attacks     | WiFi security layers            |

## üîÑ IDS vs IPS

| Feature              | IDS                                       | IPS                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Detection**        | Passive ‚Äî alerts only                      | Active ‚Äî blocks traffic                  |
| **Placement**        | Out-of-band                                | Inline (in traffic path)                 |
| **Latency Impact**   | None                                        | Yes ‚Äî can slow traffic if overburdened   |
| **Use Case**         | Forensics, alerting, audit trails           | Real-time blocking, high-risk environments |
| **False Positive Risk** | Lower impact                             | Higher impact ‚Äî may block legit traffic  |
