**Windows Event IDs** are identifiers assigned to system, security, and application events recorded by the Windows Event Log service. Monitoring and analyzing key Event IDs is critical for **threat detection**, **forensics**, and **auditing**.

---

## üéØ Purpose of Event ID Monitoring

- Detect **unauthorized access attempts**
- Monitor **privilege escalation**, **persistence**, and **log tampering**
- Correlate **user activity** with suspicious processes
- Support **SIEM rules**, **EDR alerts**, and **threat hunting**

> "Windows logs everything ‚Äî the challenge is knowing what to look for."

## üõ† Process Creation Tracking

### üîç Event ID 4688

Logs any process created on the system.

Key fields to track:
- **Creator Process Name** (`Parent`)
- **New Process Name** (`Child`)
- **Command Line Arguments** (if enabled via Group Policy)
- **Security ID / Account Name**

Useful for:
- Detecting **LOLBins** like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`
- Correlating suspicious chains like `WINWORD.exe ‚Üí powershell.exe`

## üß© Additional Noteworthy IDs

| Event ID | Description                            | Use Case                              |
|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **7045** | New service installed                  | Persistence or malware deployment     |
| **5140** | Network share accessed                 | Lateral movement, file staging        |
| **5156** | Windows Filtering Platform allowed conn| Unexpected outbound activity           |
| **4768** | Kerberos TGT request                   | AS-REP roasting detection             |
| **4769** | Kerberos service ticket request        | Service abuse/lateral movement        |
| **4771** | Kerberos pre-auth failure              | Brute force on AD accounts            |

---

## üß∞ Tools to View Event IDs

- **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`)
- **PowerShell** (`Get-WinEvent`, `Get-EventLog`)
- **Sysmon** (for enhanced logging with Event ID 1‚Äì25)
- **SIEM platforms** (Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar, Wazuh)
- **Log parsers** (Log Parser Studio, ELK Stack)

---

## üß† Best Practices

- **Enable full process command-line logging** via GPO
- **Forward logs to SIEM** or central collector
- Use **correlation rules** for:
  - `4688` + suspicious parent
  - `4625` brute force patterns
  - `1102` shortly after admin login
- Monitor **anomalies over time** (e.g., first-time logons)
