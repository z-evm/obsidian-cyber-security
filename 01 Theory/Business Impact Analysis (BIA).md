Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a key component of **risk management** and **business continuity planning (BCP)**. It identifies critical business functions, the potential impact of disruptions, and guides the prioritization of recovery strategies.

---

## üéØ Purpose of BIA

- Determine **mission-critical systems and processes**.
- Identify **dependencies** (people, technology, facilities, suppliers).
- Estimate **financial and operational impacts** of downtime.
- Establish **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**.
- Support **disaster recovery** and **incident response planning**.

## üß± BIA Key Components

| Component                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical Functions**       | Essential business operations required to sustain the organization.         |
| **Dependencies**             | Internal or external systems/resources each function relies on.            |
| **Impact Categories**        | Operational, legal, reputational, financial, compliance, safety.           |
| **Downtime Tolerance**       | Maximum tolerable period of disruption for each function.                  |
| **Recovery Requirements**    | Needed resources (personnel, data, infrastructure) to resume operations.   |
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | Maximum allowable downtime before significant impact.                |
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | Maximum tolerable data loss measured in time.                    |

## üîç BIA Process Steps

1. **Identify Business Functions**
   - Interview stakeholders and department heads.
   - Document critical services and products.

2. **Determine Dependencies**
   - Map supporting technologies, vendors, and personnel.

3. **Assess Impact**
   - Analyze effects of downtime across time intervals (e.g., 0‚Äì4 hrs, 4‚Äì24 hrs, 1‚Äì3 days).

4. **Define Recovery Objectives**
   - Establish RTO/RPO values per function.

5. **Prioritize Functions**
   - Rank based on urgency, impact, and legal obligations.

6. **Document & Report Findings**
   - Create a formal BIA report.
   - Integrate into the organization‚Äôs BCP/DRP.

## üí° Impact Categories

| Impact Type     | Examples                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Financial**     | Lost revenue, fines, penalties, increased costs.         |
| **Operational**   | Process delays, loss of productivity, resource diversion.|
| **Legal/Compliance** | Non-compliance penalties, lawsuits.                     |
| **Reputational**  | Customer dissatisfaction, media damage.                 |
| **Health & Safety** | Risks to employee or public safety.                    |
