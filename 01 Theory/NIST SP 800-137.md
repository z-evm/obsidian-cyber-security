**NIST SP 800-137**, titled *"Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations"*, provides guidelines for developing and implementing an ISCM program to maintain ongoing awareness of security and privacy risks.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Enable organizations to **maintain security posture** in real time.
- Detect and respond to changes affecting **risk exposure**.
- Support **ongoing authorization** and improve decision-making.
- Align continuous monitoring with **RMF Step 6: Monitor**.

## üîÅ ISCM Lifecycle Overview

| Phase               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Define Strategy**  | Establish organizational risk tolerance, monitoring goals, roles, and scope. |
| **Establish Program**| Select security metrics, define assessment frequencies, assign ownership.   |
| **Implement**        | Deploy tools, automate data collection, and create reporting pipelines.     |
| **Analyze & Report** | Correlate findings, detect trends, and support risk response.               |
| **Respond**          | Update POA&M, patch systems, reauthorize controls as needed.                |
| **Review & Update**  | Periodically refine ISCM strategy based on lessons learned and risk changes.|

## üß± Key ISCM Concepts

| Term                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Control Monitoring** | Repeated assessment of the effectiveness of security controls.        |
| **Risk Tolerance**        | Maximum acceptable risk level an organization is willing to take.          |
| **ISCM Strategy**         | Formal plan aligning monitoring activities with organizational risk goals. |
| **Automation**            | Use of tools (SIEM, EDR, scanners) to streamline data collection and alerts.|
| **Ongoing Authorization** | Maintain trustworthiness of a system without redoing full ATO cycle.       |

## üß∞ Example ISCM Metrics

| Metric                          | Description                               |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Patch latency                   | Time taken to apply security patches      |
| Unresolved vulnerabilities       | Number of critical/high-risk open issues |
| System change frequency          | Volume of unplanned configuration changes|
| Failed login attempts            | Brute force or unauthorized access trends |
| Asset inventory drift            | Unauthorized assets or missing devices    |

---

## üõ† Recommended Tools

- **SIEM**: Splunk, QRadar, ELK
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Nessus, Qualys
- **EDR/XDR Platforms**: CrowdStrike, SentinelOne
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, SCCM, Puppet
- **Asset Discovery**: Lansweeper, Tanium, OpenAudit

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Start with a **defined ISCM strategy** at the organizational level.
- Use **automated data feeds** where possible.
- Integrate ISCM outputs into **risk dashboards** and **POA&M updates**.
- Coordinate with incident response and change management workflows.
- Conduct **periodic reviews** to improve coverage and reduce alert fatigue.

## üîó Integration with RMF

| RMF Step   | ISCM Role                                               |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step 6** | Enables ongoing authorization and validates control effectiveness. |
| **Step 5** | Informs reauthorization or denial based on monitoring results.     |
