**Patch Management** is the process of acquiring, testing, deploying, and verifying updates (patches) to software and systems to fix **security vulnerabilities**, **bugs**, or improve **performance and functionality**.

Effective patch management is essential for maintaining **system integrity**, **resilience**, and **compliance**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> **Patch Management answers the question:**  
> _"Are we applying the necessary updates to stay secure and stable?"_

Goals:
- Close exploitable security holes
- Maintain system reliability and performance
- Ensure compliance with standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Minimize downtime due to unpatched vulnerabilities

## 🔁 Patch Management Lifecycle

| Phase               | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Inventory**      | Identify all systems and software requiring updates          |
| **2. Monitoring**     | Stay updated on vendor releases and vulnerability disclosures |
| **3. Evaluation**     | Assess the patch's relevance, urgency, and potential impact   |
| **4. Testing**        | Test in a staging environment to avoid disruptions            |
| **5. Deployment**     | Roll out the patch to production systems                      |
| **6. Verification**   | Confirm patch was applied and successful                      |
| **7. Documentation**  | Log actions, results, and lessons learned                     |

## 🔐 Patch Types

| Patch Type       | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Patch**| Fixes a known vulnerability                    |
| **Bug Fix**       | Resolves functionality or stability issues     |
| **Feature Patch** | Adds or enhances functionality                 |
| **Cumulative Update** | Bundles several patches together           |
| **Hotfix**        | Emergency fix for a critical issue             |

## 🔥 Risks of Poor Patch Management

- Exploitation of known vulnerabilities (e.g., WannaCry, Log4Shell)
- Malware and ransomware infections
- Operational downtime or system crashes
- Regulatory fines and non-compliance
- Loss of data, trust, and reputation

---

## 🧰 Patch Management Best Practices

- Maintain a **complete asset inventory**
- Subscribe to **vendor security bulletins**
- Test patches in **non-production environments**
- Use **automated patch deployment tools**
- Schedule regular **maintenance windows**
- Maintain a **patch calendar** and audit trail
- Implement **rollback plans** in case of failure

## 🧠 Patch Management vs Vulnerability Management

| Feature                  | Patch Management                          | Vulnerability Management                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                 | Applying software updates                 | Identifying and prioritizing security risks  |
| **Action-Oriented?**      | ✅ Yes                                     | ⚠️ Sometimes requires manual remediation     |
| **Tools**                 | WSUS, SCCM, Intune, etc.                  | Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, etc.                |

## 🧪 Real-World Example

> **Issue**: Microsoft Exchange zero-day vulnerability (ProxyShell)  
> **Response**:  
> - Monitor MSRC advisories  
> - Test and apply cumulative security update  
> - Validate patch success via `Get-ExchangeServer` health checks  
> - Audit logs for post-patch exploitation attempts
