**Encryption** is a fundamental technique for protecting confidentiality in cybersecurity. It transforms plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using cryptographic keys. The two main types of encryption are **symmetric** and **asymmetric**, each with unique strengths and use cases.

## üéØ Purpose of Encryption

- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to data
- **Integrity**: Detect unauthorized modifications (when paired with hashing)
- **Authentication**: Prove sender/receiver identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent denial of actions (asymmetric only)

## üß© Symmetric Encryption

> Uses the **same secret key** for both encryption and decryption.

### ‚úÖ Features:
- **Fast** and efficient for large volumes of data
- Requires **secure key exchange** beforehand
- Commonly used in bulk encryption (VPNs, disk encryption, TLS sessions)

### üîê Examples:
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES / 3DES (outdated)
- RC4 (insecure)
- Blowfish, Twofish, ChaCha20

## üîê Asymmetric Encryption

> Uses a **key pair**:
- **Public key** (for encryption)
- **Private key** (for decryption)

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Enables **secure communication without prior key exchange**
- Supports **digital signatures** and **certificates**
- Slower than symmetric encryption, but ideal for key distribution

### üîë Examples:
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- ElGamal
- DH (Diffie-Hellman ‚Äì for key exchange, not encryption itself)

## üîê How They Work Together

> In real-world systems like **TLS**, both methods are used:

1. **Asymmetric** encryption is used to **securely exchange** a session key.
2. That session key is then used for **symmetric encryption** (e.g., AES) for fast, bulk data transfer.

## üß† Real-World Use Cases

| Application             | Encryption Type Used               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **VPN (IPSec/OpenVPN)** | Symmetric (AES, ChaCha20)          |
| **HTTPS/TLS**           | Both (RSA/ECC + AES)               |
| **Email Signing (PGP)** | Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)              |
| **Disk Encryption**     | Symmetric (BitLocker, FileVault)   |
| **SSH Authentication**  | Asymmetric                         |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Tips

- Always use **strong key lengths** (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- Rotate keys and certificates regularly
- Never hardcode symmetric keys into source code
- Use **trusted certificate authorities** for public key distribution
