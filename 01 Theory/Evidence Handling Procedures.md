Proper **evidence handling procedures** are critical in ensuring that digital evidence remains authentic, reliable, and admissible in legal, regulatory, or internal investigations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔐 Preserve integrity of evidence
- 📦 Maintain a clear **chain of custody**
- 🧠 Avoid contamination, alteration, or loss
- ⚖️ Ensure admissibility in court or compliance reviews

## 🔄 Evidence Handling Workflow

### 1. 🔍 Identification
- Determine if the item contains potential evidence
- Tag files, devices, or logs for collection
- Note location, system status (on/off), and users involved

### 2. 🔐 Preservation
- Isolate the system (physically or logically)
- Use **write blockers** for drives
- Capture system memory before shutdown (if applicable)
- Take cryptographic hashes before and after imaging

### 3. 📥 Collection
- Acquire full disk images, volatile memory (RAM), logs, etc.
- Use **forensically sound tools** (e.g., `dd`, FTK Imager)
- Label each item with a unique identifier
- Document date/time, collector name, method used

### 4. 📦 Documentation
- Maintain thorough notes at every step:
  - Who handled the evidence
  - What actions were performed
  - Where and how it was stored or transferred
- Use standard evidence collection forms

### 5. 🧾 Chain of Custody
A formal record of **who had access to the evidence** and **when**.

#### Includes:
- Case ID and evidence description
- Names, dates, and signatures of handlers
- Purpose of access or transfer
- Integrity checks (e.g., hash values)

---

## 🔒 Evidence Storage

- Use tamper-evident bags, containers, or lockers
- Store in access-controlled, monitored environments
- Limit access to authorized personnel only
- Encrypt digital evidence when stored on portable media

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Never work on original evidence—use a **forensic copy**
- Use **hashing (e.g., SHA256)** to validate integrity
- Log every action taken on the evidence
- Label evidence clearly and consistently
- Keep evidence secure throughout the investigation

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

- Comply with laws and standards:
  - **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **FISMA**, **SOX**
- Ensure actions are **defensible in court**
- Use **standardized, documented procedures**
- Avoid actions that could invalidate the evidence
