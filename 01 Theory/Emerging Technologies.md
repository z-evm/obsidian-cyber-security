## üìö Key Emerging Technologies (Security+ Focus)

| Technology                  | Description                                                                            | Security Implications                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cloud Computing**         | On-demand access to computing/storage via internet                                     | Data breaches, shared responsibility, access control                |
| **Virtualization**          | Simulated environments (e.g., VMs, containers)                                         | Escape risks, hypervisor attacks, isolation enforcement             |
| **5G Networks**             | High-speed, low-latency mobile connectivity                                            | Increases IoT attack surface, harder to monitor                      |
| **IoT (Internet of Things)**| Embedded network-connected devices (sensors, cameras, etc.)                            | Insecure defaults, lack of patching, botnets                         |
| **Blockchain/DLT**          | Distributed ledgers for tamper-evident records                                         | Smart contract flaws, consensus manipulation, 51% attacks            |
| **AI & Machine Learning**   | Automated data analysis, pattern recognition, threat detection                         | Adversarial input, data poisoning, explainability concerns           |
| **Quantum Computing**       | Leverages quantum mechanics for computing                                               | Breaks classical encryption (RSA, ECC), requires quantum-safe crypto |
| **Edge Computing**          | Data processing at or near source (devices, local nodes)                              | Physical tampering, inconsistent security policies                   |
| **Serverless Architectures**| Execution of code in stateless containers without server management                    | Dependency trust, reduced visibility, function abuse                 |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Trust nothing by default, verify everything (least privilege + continuous validation) | Reduces lateral movement, requires identity and access discipline    |
| **Self-Sovereign Identity** | User-controlled identity using blockchain & DIDs                                       | Key management, interoperability, regulatory recognition             |

## üß© Integration & Overlap

Many of these technologies intersect:
- **AI + Threat Detection** ‚Üí Intelligent SOC automation
- **Blockchain + Identity** ‚Üí Decentralized ID & Verifiable Credentials
- **IoT + 5G + Edge** ‚Üí Smart cities, autonomous vehicles
- **Virtualization + Cloud** ‚Üí Scalable, cost-efficient infrastructure

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Confidentiality**: Data handled outside traditional boundaries
- **Integrity**: Complex data flows ‚Üí more potential tampering points
- **Availability**: Reliance on networks/cloud = new DoS targets
- **Authentication & Access**: Dynamic identity models needed
- **Monitoring**: Encrypted traffic, rapid scaling hinder visibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management Challenges

| Area                        | Emerging Concern                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack Surface**          | Widens with IoT, edge devices, serverless       |
| **Control and Governance**  | Cloud and decentralized systems complicate control |
| **Encryption Obsolescence** | Quantum computing threatens legacy crypto       |
| **Threat Actor Sophistication** | AI used offensively by attackers           |
