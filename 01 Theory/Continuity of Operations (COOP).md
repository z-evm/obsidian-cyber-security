**Continuity of Operations (COOP)** is a U.S. federal government‚Äìcentric strategy designed to ensure that essential functions continue during and after a wide range of emergencies. While COOP is primarily used in the public sector, its principles are applicable across all industries.

---

## üéØ Purpose of COOP

- Ensure continued performance of **essential government functions**.
- Maintain **constitutional authority**, **civil control**, and **national security**.
- Minimize **disruption to operations**, personnel, and public services.
- Establish **alternate facilities**, **delegations of authority**, and **communications**.

## üß± Core COOP Elements

| Component                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Essential Functions**      | Critical operations that must be sustained without interruption.            |
| **Delegation of Authority**  | Pre-defined, legally binding hierarchy of command.                          |
| **Orders of Succession**     | Who assumes leadership roles if primary personnel are unavailable.          |
| **Alternate Facilities**     | Pre-identified backup locations to resume operations.                       |
| **Continuity Communications**| Redundant communication systems (voice, data, radio, satellite).            |
| **Vital Records Management** | Secure access to critical data, systems, and documentation.                 |
| **Human Capital**            | Procedures for accounting for and deploying key personnel.                  |
| **Reconstitution**           | Transition back to normal operations post-disruption.                       |

## üîÅ COOP Phases

1. **Readiness and Preparedness**
   - Develop and test the COOP plan.
   - Conduct training and tabletop exercises.

2. **Activation and Relocation**
   - Triggered by a significant emergency (natural disaster, cyberattack, etc.).
   - Move essential staff to alternate facilities.

3. **Continuity Operations**
   - Maintain critical operations at the alternate site using COOP procedures.

4. **Reconstitution**
   - Return to normal operations, repair primary site, and resume full capacity.

## üìã Key Considerations

| Topic                   | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **COOP Plan Review**    | Should be reviewed and updated annually or after major incidents.     |
| **COOP Testing**        | Includes drills, communications checks, and relocation exercises.     |
| **Integration with BCP**| COOP complements broader [[Business Continuity Planning (BCP)]].     |
| **Legal Mandates**      | Required for federal agencies under **FCD-1**, **NCPIP**, and **FISMA**.|

## üõ°Ô∏è COOP vs. BCP

| COOP                           | BCP                                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Government-mandated (e.g., FCD-1) | Business-driven planning framework         |
| Focus on **essential functions** | Focus on **critical business operations**   |
| Emphasizes **orders of succession**, **delegation** | Emphasizes **risk analysis**, **impact recovery** |
| Specific to **national security & governance** | Applies across industries and sectors    |
