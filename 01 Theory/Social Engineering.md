**Social Engineering** is a manipulation technique used by attackers to **exploit human behavior** rather than technical vulnerabilities. It involves deceiving individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.

> The weakest link in security is often **human trust**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

> **Social Engineering answers the question (for attackers):**  
> _"How can I trick someone into giving me access?"_

Goals:
- Gain unauthorized access to systems, facilities, or data
- Evade technical controls through **psychological manipulation**
- Install malware or harvest credentials
- Establish a foothold for further attacks

## üß± Common Social Engineering Techniques

| Technique               | Description                                                | Example                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing**             | Fraudulent emails designed to trick users                  | "Reset your password now!" with malicious link            |
| **Spear Phishing**       | Targeted phishing tailored to an individual                | Email spoofing a CEO requesting urgent wire transfer      |
| **Whaling**              | Phishing targeting high-profile executives                 | Fake legal subpoena sent to CFO                           |
| **Smishing**             | SMS-based phishing messages                                | "Your bank account is locked. Click here to unlock."      |
| **Vishing**              | Voice calls used to impersonate trusted entities           | Fake tech support call asking for remote access           |
| **Pretexting**           | Attacker invents a scenario to gain trust                  | Pretending to be an auditor or IT support                 |
| **Baiting**              | Enticing victims with a tempting item                      | USB drive labeled "Employee Salaries" left in parking lot |
| **Tailgating (Piggybacking)** | Gaining physical access by following someone else    | "I forgot my badge ‚Äî can you hold the door?"              |
| **Quid Pro Quo**         | Offering something in exchange for access or info          | Free software in exchange for login credentials           |

## üõ† Signs of Social Engineering

- Unsolicited communication requesting personal or login info
- Sense of **urgency** or pressure to act quickly
- Requests that bypass normal procedures
- Poor grammar, spelling, or formatting
- Spoofed email addresses or phone numbers
- Suspicious attachments or unexpected links

## üì¶ Delivery Vectors

| Vector             | Examples                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Email**            | Phishing, spear phishing, malicious links |
| **Phone/Voice**      | Vishing, fake support calls              |
| **Text/SMS**         | Smishing scams                           |
| **Physical Presence**| Tailgating, badge cloning                |
| **Social Media**     | Impersonation, oversharing bait          |
| **Removable Media**  | Infected USB drops (baiting)             |

## üõ° Defense Strategies

- **User training and awareness**
- **Phishing simulations and drills**
- **Email filtering and spam controls**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Caller verification procedures**
- **Physical access controls and badge policies**
- **Least privilege and need-to-know principles**

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Educate employees on **how to recognize and report** social engineering attempts
- Establish a **security culture** of skepticism and verification
- Implement **incident response procedures** for suspected social engineering
- Use **SIEM and logging** to detect anomalies triggered by social engineering
- Enforce policies like **Clean Desk** and **Device Locking**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why It's Effective

- Exploits **psychological principles** (authority, fear, curiosity, urgency)
- Leverages **trust in brands or coworkers**
- Bypasses technical defenses using **human interaction**
- Often the **initial vector** in large-scale breaches
