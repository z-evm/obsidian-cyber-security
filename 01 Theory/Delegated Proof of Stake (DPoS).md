> Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm that enhances the efficiency of traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) by allowing stakeholders to vote for a small number of trusted delegates (validators) who produce and validate blocks on behalf of the network.

---

## üìå What Is DPoS?

- A **representative democracy** model for blockchain consensus.
- Stakeholders vote using their coin holdings to elect a group of **delegates** (also called block producers or witnesses).
- Delegates take turns validating blocks and are rewarded.
- Misbehaving delegates can be voted out.

> Designed to improve **performance, energy efficiency, and governance** over PoW and standard PoS.

## üß† Key Characteristics

| Feature                | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Voting-Based**        | Token holders vote to select validators                               |
| **Limited Validator Set** | Only a fixed number of delegates (e.g., 21‚Äì100) actively validate blocks |
| **High Throughput**     | Fewer validators = faster block production                            |
| **Governance Model**    | Delegates can propose protocol changes subject to community approval   |
| **Accountability**      | Poorly performing delegates can be voted out                          |

---

## üîÑ How DPoS Works

1. **Token Holders Vote**: Users cast votes using their staked tokens to elect delegates.
2. **Top Delegates Selected**: Typically 21‚Äì100 top vote-getters are allowed to validate.
3. **Delegates Take Turns**: Produce blocks in a scheduled, round-robin fashion.
4. **Block Rewards Shared**: Some systems allow rewards to be shared with voters (incentivization).
5. **Governance**: Delegates often vote on parameter changes, upgrades, etc.

| Risk / Threat               | Mitigation                                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Centralization of Power**  | Community governance, transparent voting                          |
| **Voter Apathy**             | Reward sharing to encourage participation                         |
| **Cartel Formation**         | Rotation rules and on-chain accountability                         |
| **Sybil Attacks**            | Economic cost of acquiring voting power                            |
| **Block Censorship**         | Delegate replacement if abuse is detected                          |
