**Distributed systems** consist of multiple independent components that communicate and coordinate over a network to achieve a common goal. While they offer **scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility**, they introduce unique **security challenges** due to their **decentralized nature, communication overhead, and trust boundaries**.

## üéØ Security Goals in Distributed Systems

- üîê **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to data in transit or at rest
- ‚úÖ **Integrity**: Ensure data is not tampered with during communication or processing
- üë§ **Authentication**: Verify identities of users, nodes, and services
- üßæ **Authorization**: Enforce access controls and privileges
- üìú **Accountability**: Maintain logs and traceability of actions
- üß± **Availability**: Ensure fault tolerance against DoS and node failures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Threats in Distributed Systems

| Threat                       | Description                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** | Interception of communication between distributed nodes |
| **Replay Attacks**           | Reuse of intercepted valid data to spoof authentication |
| **Distributed DoS (DDoS)**   | Resource exhaustion via large-scale request flooding    |
| **Data Leakage**             | Unauthorized access to sensitive data across nodes      |
| **Privilege Escalation**     | Exploiting misconfigured access controls                |
| **Insider Threats**          | Malicious actions from trusted internal users or nodes  |
| **Insecure APIs**            | Vulnerable endpoints between distributed services       |

## üß± Core Security Mechanisms

| Mechanism                 | Role in Securing Distributed Systems                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TLS/SSL**               | Secures node-to-node and client-server communication        |
| **Mutual Authentication** | Requires both parties to authenticate via certs or keys     |
| **RBAC/ABAC**             | Enforces access based on identity and attributes            |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Trust no component by default, verify each interaction    |
| **Token-Based Auth (JWT, OAuth2)** | Stateless identity propagation across services  |
| **Logging & Auditing**    | Tracks events across systems for anomaly detection          |
| **Rate Limiting / Throttling** | Mitigates abuse of APIs and services                 |
| **Encryption at Rest**    | Secures distributed storage and object data                 |
