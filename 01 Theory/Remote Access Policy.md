A **Remote Access Policy** defines the rules and security requirements for connecting to an organization‚Äôs internal systems and data from **offsite or non-corporate networks**. It ensures that remote users access resources **securely**, **reliably**, and in **compliance** with company policies and applicable regulations.

## üéØ Policy Objectives

- Enable **secure remote connectivity** to business-critical systems  
- Reduce risk of **unauthorized access**, **data leakage**, or **compromise**  
- Enforce consistent controls across VPN, cloud, and mobile access  
- Maintain regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)

## üì° Access Control & Monitoring

- Enforce **least privilege access** based on role
- Log all remote sessions (login, duration, actions)
- Monitor via **SIEM**, **NAC**, and VPN logs
- Block access from **unauthorized geolocations**
- Auto-timeout inactive sessions after X minutes

---

## üö´ Prohibited Activities

- Using **public/shared computers** to access internal systems  
- Disabling or bypassing endpoint security controls  
- Accessing restricted resources without authorization  
- Transferring corporate data to **personal cloud services** or **USB drives**
