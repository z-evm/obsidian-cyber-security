**Web Filtering** is a security control that restricts or monitors user access to web content based on **URL categories**, **domains**, **content types**, or **reputation scores**. It helps enforce organizational policies, block malicious sites, and limit exposure to data leakage or inappropriate material.

## üéØ Objectives of Web Filtering

- Block access to **malicious or phishing websites**
- Prevent **data exfiltration** via unauthorized services
- Enforce **acceptable use policies (AUP)**
- Control **bandwidth usage** and reduce productivity loss
- Comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., CIPA, HIPAA)

## üß± Filtering Methods

| Method             | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **URL Filtering**   | Block or allow based on domain/path              |
| **Category Filtering** | Use reputation databases to block "Social Media", "Gambling", etc. |
| **Keyword Filtering** | Match specific terms in URLs or content        |
| **Reputation Filtering** | Block sites flagged for malware/phishing   |
| **TLS Inspection** | Decrypt HTTPS to inspect and filter content      |
| **File Type Filtering** | Block downloads of .exe, .zip, etc.         |

## üîç Security Use Cases

| Threat or Risk         | Filtering Mitigation                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Phishing Sites**      | Block by domain or threat reputation           |
| **Malware Hosting**     | Block C2 download URLs or file types           |
| **Data Exfiltration**   | Block pastebin, file sharing, anonymous proxies|
| **Shadow IT**           | Block access to unauthorized SaaS tools       |
| **Policy Violations**   | Enforce AUP (e.g., social media during work)   |

---

## üß† Integration with Other Controls

- **SIEM**: Log filtered attempts, alert on policy violations
- **DLP**: Scan outbound content during HTTP/S uploads
- **IAM**: Enforce filtering based on identity or user role
- **Firewall**: Enforce filtering rules inline or via proxy chaining

---

## üìÑ Logging & Reporting

Most web filters support logs such as:

- Blocked/allowed domains
- User/IP requesting the site
- URL category or risk score
- Time of request
- Action taken (block, allow, warn)

Use logs for **incident response**, **forensics**, and **compliance auditing**.

| Challenge                 | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTPS Inspection**      | Required to inspect encrypted traffic; may break some apps |
| **False Positives**       | Legitimate sites may be misclassified            |
| **Privacy Concerns**      | User activity is closely monitored               |
