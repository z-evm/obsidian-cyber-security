## üéØ Purpose

> **User Awareness Training answers the question:**  
> _"Do our users know how to spot and avoid threats?"_

Goals:
- Reduce **human error**
- Prevent **phishing and social engineering attacks**
- Enforce **security policies** and best practices
- Build a **culture of cybersecurity awareness**

- Use **interactive and realistic examples**
- Conduct **regular phishing simulations**
- Reinforce with **short, frequent sessions** over one-time events
- Provide **positive reinforcement** and feedback
- Measure outcomes and **adjust based on risk trends**
