**Endpoint Protection** refers to security measures designed to protect individual devices—such as laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile devices—from cybersecurity threats. These devices serve as access points to enterprise networks and are often targeted by attackers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🛡️ Prevent malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access
- 🧠 Detect suspicious behavior on endpoints
- 🔁 Provide visibility into device activity
- 📢 Respond to incidents in real time
- 🧾 Support compliance and audit requirements

## 🧱 Core Features of Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP)

| Feature                   | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antivirus/Anti-malware**| Detects and removes known threats using signatures or heuristics |
| **Firewall**              | Controls inbound/outbound traffic at the host level           |
| **Device Control**        | Blocks unauthorized USB or peripheral usage                  |
| **Web Filtering**         | Restricts access to malicious or inappropriate websites      |
| **Application Control**   | Allows only whitelisted software to run                      |
| **Data Loss Prevention**  | Prevents unauthorized transfer of sensitive data             |

## ⚔️ Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

**EDR** extends basic endpoint protection by providing **real-time monitoring**, **threat hunting**, and **forensic investigation capabilities**.

### EDR Capabilities:
- 🧠 Behavioral analysis of processes and users
- 🔎 Threat intelligence correlation
- 📊 Timeline reconstruction of incidents
- 🚨 Automated alerting and remediation
- 📦 Isolation of infected endpoints

## 🔄 EPP vs EDR

| Feature          | EPP                                | EDR                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Detection        | Signature & heuristic-based         | Behavior & analytics-based             |
| Response         | Limited (block/quarantine)          | Real-time response & investigation     |
| Visibility       | Basic threat logs                   | Deep forensic insight, timelines       |
| Use Case         | General malware prevention          | Advanced threat detection & IR         |

## ✅ Best Practices

- 📦 Use **centralized management** consoles for policy enforcement
- 🔐 Enforce **least privilege** and application whitelisting
- 🧪 Regularly test detection capabilities
- 🕵️ Enable **real-time monitoring and alerting**
- 🔄 Keep protection agents **updated automatically**
- 📁 Encrypt endpoint drives and enforce secure configurations

---

## 🔐 Endpoint Hardening Techniques

- Disable unused ports and services
- Enforce strong password policies and MFA
- Limit admin access
- Use secure baseline configurations (e.g., CIS Benchmarks)
